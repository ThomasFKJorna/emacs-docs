## Why make this website?

I do not enjoy browsing the Emacs documentation within Emacs nor on the GNU website. The main things lacking for me are

1. An easy way to get an overview of all the topics (the sidebar)
2. Good search functionality

## Why name it Emacs Docs?

Mostly so it can be easily found when you ~google~ look it up with your search engine of choice, and because naming things is hard ðŸ¤·

## What is that adorable little mascot called?

Their name is Ellie!

## Copyright?

Should be good! The terms of the GFDL (GNU Free Documentation License) allow such modifications.

## Can you include X?

Maybe! I want to limit this website to documentation of major Emacs packages, not make an Emacs-wiki clone. If you have a suggestion let me know on Github!

The way these docs are generated work best if the authors produce on big HTML file such as the Elisp manual, otherwise modifications will have to be made.

## There's something wrong!

Whoops! Sorry! HTML does not lend itself to perfect conversion to Markdown, so some links could be messed up. I keep a list of "bad" links [here](https://github.com/ThomasFKJorna/emacs-docs/bad-links.json) to which you can add the incorrect link url and the correct one, meaning it should be fixed next build.

## Do you have any other fantastic projects?

Why yes! I maintain [org-roam-ui](https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam-ui), a way to interact with your org-roam Zettelkasten more visually.

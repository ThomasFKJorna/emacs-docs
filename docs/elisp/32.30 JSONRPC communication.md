The `jsonrpc` library implements the JSONRPC specification, version 2.0, as it is described in [https://www.jsonrpc.org/](https://www.jsonrpc.org/). As the name suggests, JSONRPC is a generic *Remote Procedure Call* protocol designed around JSON objects, which you can convert to and from Lisp objects (see [Parsing JSON](Parsing-JSON)).

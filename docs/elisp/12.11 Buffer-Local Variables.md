slug: Buffer_002dLocal-Variables
---

Global and local variable bindings are found in most programming languages in one form or another. Emacs, however, also supports additional, unusual kinds of variable binding, such as *buffer-local* bindings, which apply only in one buffer. Having different values for a variable in different buffers is an important customization method. (Variables can also have bindings that are local to each terminal. See [Multiple Terminals](/docs/elisp/Multiple-Terminals).)

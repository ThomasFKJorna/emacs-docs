The `display` text property (or overlay property) is used to insert images into text, and to control other aspects of how text displays. The value of the `display` property should be a display specification, or a list or vector containing several display specifications. Display specifications in the same `display` property value generally apply in parallel to the text they cover.

If several sources (overlays and/or a text property) specify values for the `display` property, only one of the values takes effect, following the rules of `get-char-property`. See [Examining Properties](Examining-Properties).

Some of the display specifications allow inclusion of Lisp forms, which are evaluated at display time. This could be unsafe in certain situations, e.g., when the display specification was generated by some external program/agent. Wrapping a display specification in a list that begins with the special symbol `disable-eval`, as in `('disable-eval spec)`<!-- /@w -->, will disable evaluation of any Lisp in `spec`, while still supporting all the other display property features.

The rest of this section describes several kinds of display specifications and what they mean.

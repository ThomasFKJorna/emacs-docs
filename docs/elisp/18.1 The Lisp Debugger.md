The ordinary *Lisp debugger* provides the ability to suspend evaluation of a form. While evaluation is suspended (a state that is commonly known as a *break*), you may examine the run time stack, examine the values of local or global variables, or change those values. Since a break is a recursive edit, all the usual editing facilities of Emacs are available; you can even run programs that will enter the debugger recursively. See [Recursive Editing](Recursive-Editing).

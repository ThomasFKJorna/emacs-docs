Edebug is a source-level debugger for Emacs Lisp programs, with which you can:

*   Step through evaluation, stopping before and after each expression.
*   Set conditional or unconditional breakpoints.
*   Stop when a specified condition is true (the global break event).
*   Trace slow or fast, stopping briefly at each stop point, or at each breakpoint.
*   Display expression results and evaluate expressions as if outside of Edebug.
*   Automatically re-evaluate a list of expressions and display their results each time Edebug updates the display.
*   Output trace information on function calls and returns.
*   Stop when an error occurs.
*   Display a backtrace, omitting Edebug’s own frames.
*   Specify argument evaluation for macros and defining forms.
*   Obtain rudimentary coverage testing and frequency counts.

The first three sections below should tell you enough about Edebug to start using it.

A lambda expression is a function object written in Lisp. Here is an example:

```lisp
(lambda (x)
  "Return the hyperbolic cosine of X."
  (* 0.5 (+ (exp x) (exp (- x)))))
```

In Emacs Lisp, such a list is a valid expression which evaluates to a function object.

A lambda expression, by itself, has no name; it is an *anonymous function*. Although lambda expressions can be used this way (see [Anonymous Functions](/docs/elisp/Anonymous-Functions)), they are more commonly associated with symbols to make *named functions* (see [Function Names](/docs/elisp/Function-Names)). Before going into these details, the following subsections describe the components of a lambda expression and what they do.

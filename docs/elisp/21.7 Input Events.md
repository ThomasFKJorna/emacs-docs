slug: Input-Events
---

The Emacs command loop reads a sequence of *input events* that represent keyboard or mouse activity, or system events sent to Emacs. The events for keyboard activity are characters or symbols; other events are always lists. This section describes the representation and meaning of input events in detail.

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **eventp** *object*

This function returns non-`nil` if `object` is an input event or event type.

Note that any non-`nil` symbol might be used as an event or an event type; `eventp` cannot distinguish whether a symbol is intended by Lisp code to be used as an event.

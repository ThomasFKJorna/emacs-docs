This section describes how characters are actually displayed by Emacs. Typically, a character is displayed as a *glyph* (a graphical symbol which occupies one character position on the screen), whose appearance corresponds to the character itself. For example, the character ‘`a`’ (character code 97) is displayed as ‘`a`’. Some characters, however, are displayed specially. For example, the formfeed character (character code 12) is usually displayed as a sequence of two glyphs, ‘`^L`’, while the newline character (character code 10) starts a new screen line.

You can modify how each character is displayed by defining a *display table*, which maps each character code into a sequence of glyphs. See [Display Tables](/docs/elisp/Display-Tables).

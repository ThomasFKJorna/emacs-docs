slug: Format-Properties
---

These text properties affect the behavior of the fill commands. They are used for representing formatted text. See [Filling](/docs/elisp/Filling), and [Margins](/docs/elisp/Margins).

### `hard`

If a newline character has this property, it is a â€œhard" newline. The fill commands do not alter hard newlines and do not move words across them. However, this property takes effect only if the `use-hard-newlines` minor mode is enabled. See [Hard and Soft Newlines](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Hard-and-Soft-Newlines) in The GNU Emacs Manual.

### `right-margin`

This property specifies an extra right margin for filling this part of the text.

### `left-margin`

This property specifies an extra left margin for filling this part of the text.

### `justification`

This property specifies the style of justification for filling this part of the text.

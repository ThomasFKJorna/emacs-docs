When you create a local binding for a variable, that binding takes effect only within a limited portion of the program (see [Local Variables](/docs/elisp/Local-Variables)). This section describes exactly what this means.

Each local binding has a certain *scope* and *extent*. *Scope* refers to *where* in the textual source code the binding can be accessed. *Extent* refers to *when*, as the program is executing, the binding exists.

By default, the local bindings that Emacs creates are *dynamic bindings*. Such a binding has *dynamic scope*, meaning that any part of the program can potentially access the variable binding. It also has *dynamic extent*, meaning that the binding lasts only while the binding construct (such as the body of a `let` form) is being executed.

Emacs can optionally create *lexical bindings*. A lexical binding has *lexical scope*, meaning that any reference to the variable must be located textually within the binding construct[^1]. It also has *indefinite extent*, meaning that under some circumstances the binding can live on even after the binding construct has finished executing, by means of special objects called *closures*.

The following subsections describe dynamic binding and lexical binding in greater detail, and how to enable lexical binding in Emacs Lisp programs.

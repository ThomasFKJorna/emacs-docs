*Byte-code function objects* are produced by byte-compiling Lisp code (see [Byte Compilation](Byte-Compilation)). Internally, a byte-code function object is much like a vector; however, the evaluator handles this data type specially when it appears in a function call. See [Byte-Code Objects](Byte_002dCode-Objects).

The printed representation and read syntax for a byte-code function object is like that for a vector, with an additional ‘`#`’ before the opening ‘`[`’.

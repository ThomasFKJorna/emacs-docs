slug: Displaying-Buffers
---

This section describes lower-level functions Emacs uses to find or create a window for displaying a specified buffer. The common workhorse of these functions is `display-buffer` which eventually handles all incoming requests for buffer display (see [Choosing Window](/docs/elisp/Choosing-Window)).

`display-buffer` delegates the task of finding a suitable window to so-called action functions (see [Buffer Display Action Functions](/docs/elisp/Buffer-Display-Action-Functions)). First, `display-buffer` compiles a so-called action alist—a special association list that action functions can use to fine-tune their behavior. Then it passes that alist on to each action function it calls (see [Buffer Display Action Alists](/docs/elisp/Buffer-Display-Action-Alists)).

The behavior of `display-buffer` is highly customizable. To understand how customizations are used in practice, you may wish to study examples illustrating the order of precedence which `display-buffer` uses to call action functions (see [Precedence of Action Functions](/docs/elisp/Precedence-of-Action-Functions)). To avoid conflicts between Lisp programs calling `display-buffer` and user customizations of its behavior, it may make sense to follow a number of guidelines which are sketched in the final part of this section (see [The Zen of Buffer Display](/docs/elisp/The-Zen-of-Buffer-Display)).

You can alter the contents of a mutable string via operations described in this section. See [Mutability](/docs/elisp/Mutability).

The most basic way to alter the contents of an existing string is with `aset` (see [Array Functions](/docs/elisp/Array-Functions)). `(aset string idx char)` stores `char` into `string` at index `idx`. Each character occupies one or more bytes, and if `char` needs a different number of bytes from the character already present at that index, `aset` signals an error.

A more powerful function is `store-substring`:

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **store-substring** *string idx obj*

This function alters part of the contents of the string `string`, by storing `obj` starting at index `idx`. The argument `obj` may be either a character or a (smaller) string.

Since it is impossible to change the length of an existing string, it is an error if `obj` doesn’t fit within `string`’s actual length, or if any new character requires a different number of bytes from the character currently present at that point in `string`.

To clear out a string that contained a password, use `clear-string`:

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **clear-string** *string*

This makes `string` a unibyte string and clears its contents to zeros. It may also change `string`’s length.

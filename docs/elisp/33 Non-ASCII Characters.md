| • [Converting Representations](Converting-Representations) |    | Converting unibyte to multibyte and vice versa.                                            |

| • [Character Sets](Character-Sets)                         |    | The space of possible character codes is divided into various character sets.              |
| • [Scanning Charsets](Scanning-Charsets)                   |    | Which character sets are used in a buffer?                                                 |
| • [Translation of Characters](Translation-of-Characters)   |    | Translation tables are used for conversion.                                                |
| • [Coding Systems](Coding-Systems)                         |    | Coding systems are conversions for saving files.                                           |
| • [Input Methods](Input-Methods)                           |    | Input methods allow users to enter various non-ASCII characters without special keyboards. |

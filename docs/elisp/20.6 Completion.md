*Completion* is a feature that fills in the rest of a name starting from an abbreviation for it. Completion works by comparing the user’s input against a list of valid names and determining how much of the name is determined uniquely by what the user has typed. For example, when you type `C-x b` (`switch-to-buffer`) and then type the first few letters of the name of the buffer to which you wish to switch, and then type `TAB` (`minibuffer-complete`), Emacs extends the name as far as it can.

Standard Emacs commands offer completion for names of symbols, files, buffers, and processes; with the functions in this section, you can implement completion for other kinds of names.

The `try-completion` function is the basic primitive for completion: it returns the longest determined completion of a given initial string, with a given set of strings to match against.

The function `completing-read` provides a higher-level interface for completion. A call to `completing-read` specifies how to determine the list of valid names. The function then activates the minibuffer with a local keymap that binds a few keys to commands useful for completion. Other functions provide convenient simple interfaces for reading certain kinds of names with completion.

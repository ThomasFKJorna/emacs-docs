slug: Reading-Input
---

The editor command loop reads key sequences using the function `read-key-sequence`, which uses `read-event`. These and other functions for event input are also available for use in Lisp programs. See also `momentary-string-display` in [Temporary Displays](Temporary-Displays), and `sit-for` in [Waiting](Waiting). See [Terminal Input](Terminal-Input), for functions and variables for controlling terminal input modes and debugging terminal input.

For higher-level input facilities, see [Minibuffers](Minibuffers).

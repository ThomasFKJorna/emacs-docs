slug: Modifying-Lists
---

You can modify the CAR and CDR contents of a cons cell with the primitives `setcar` and `setcdr`. These are destructive operations because they change existing list structure. Destructive operations should be applied only to mutable lists, that is, lists constructed via `cons`, `list` or similar operations. Lists created by quoting are part of the program and should not be changed by destructive operations. See [Mutability](Mutability).

> **Common Lisp note:** Common Lisp uses functions `rplaca` and `rplacd` to alter list structure; they change structure the same way as `setcar` and `setcdr`, but the Common Lisp functions return the cons cell while `setcar` and `setcdr` return the new CAR or CDR.

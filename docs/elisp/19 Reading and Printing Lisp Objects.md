*Printing* and *reading* are the operations of converting Lisp objects to textual form and vice versa. They use the printed representations and read syntax described in [Lisp Data Types](Lisp-Data-Types).

This chapter describes the Lisp functions for reading and printing. It also describes *streams*, which specify where to get the text (if reading) or where to put it (if printing).

Macro expansion can have counterintuitive consequences. This section describes some important consequences that can lead to trouble, and rules to follow to avoid trouble.

| • [Wrong Time](/docs/elisp/Wrong-Time)                       |    | Do the work in the expansion, not in the macro.                |
| • [Argument Evaluation](/docs/elisp/Argument-Evaluation)     |    | The expansion should evaluate each macro arg once.             |
| • [Surprising Local Vars](/docs/elisp/Surprising-Local-Vars) |    | Local variable bindings in the expansion require special care. |
| • [Eval During Expansion](/docs/elisp/Eval-During-Expansion) |    | Don’t evaluate them; put them in the expansion.                |
| • [Repeated Expansion](/docs/elisp/Repeated-Expansion)       |    | Avoid depending on how many times expansion is done.           |

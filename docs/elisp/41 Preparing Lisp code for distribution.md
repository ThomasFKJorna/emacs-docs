Emacs provides a standard way to distribute Emacs Lisp code to users. A *package* is a collection of one or more files, formatted and bundled in such a way that users can easily download, install, uninstall, and upgrade it.

The following sections describe how to create a package, and how to put it in a *package archive* for others to download. See [Packages](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Packages) in The GNU Emacs Manual, for a description of user-level features of the packaging system.

slug: Vectors

A *vector* is a general-purpose array whose elements can be any Lisp objects. (By contrast, the elements of a string can only be characters. See [Strings and Characters](/docs/elisp/Strings-and-Characters).) Vectors are used in Emacs for many purposes: as key sequences (see [Key Sequences](/docs/elisp/Key-Sequences)), as symbol-lookup tables (see [Creating Symbols](/docs/elisp/Creating-Symbols)), as part of the representation of a byte-compiled function (see [Byte Compilation](/docs/elisp/Byte-Compilation)), and more.

Like other arrays, vectors use zero-origin indexing: the first element has index 0.

Vectors are printed with square brackets surrounding the elements. Thus, a vector whose elements are the symbols `a`, `b` and `a` is printed as `[a b a]`. You can write vectors in the same way in Lisp input.

A vector, like a string or a number, is considered a constant for evaluation: the result of evaluating it is the same vector. This does not evaluate or even examine the elements of the vector. See [Self-Evaluating Forms](/docs/elisp/Self_002dEvaluating-Forms). Vectors written with square brackets should not be modified via `aset` or other destructive operations. See [Mutability](/docs/elisp/Mutability).

Here are examples illustrating these principles:

```lisp
(setq avector [1 two '(three) "four" [five]])
     ⇒ [1 two '(three) "four" [five]]
(eval avector)
     ⇒ [1 two '(three) "four" [five]]
(eq avector (eval avector))
     ⇒ t
```

The functions `ffloor`, `fceiling`, `fround`, and `ftruncate` take a floating-point argument and return a floating-point result whose value is a nearby integer. `ffloor` returns the nearest integer below; `fceiling`, the nearest integer above; `ftruncate`, the nearest integer in the direction towards zero; `fround`, the nearest integer.

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **ffloor** *float*

This function rounds `float` to the next lower integral value, and returns that value as a floating-point number.

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **fceiling** *float*

This function rounds `float` to the next higher integral value, and returns that value as a floating-point number.

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **ftruncate** *float*

This function rounds `float` towards zero to an integral value, and returns that value as a floating-point number.

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **fround** *float*

This function rounds `float` to the nearest integral value, and returns that value as a floating-point number. Rounding a value equidistant between two integers returns the even integer.

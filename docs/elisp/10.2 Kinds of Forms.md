slug: Forms
---

A Lisp object that is intended to be evaluated is called a *form* (or an *expression*). How Emacs evaluates a form depends on its data type. Emacs has three different kinds of form that are evaluated differently: symbols, lists, and all other types. This section describes all three kinds, one by one, starting with the other types, which are self-evaluating forms.

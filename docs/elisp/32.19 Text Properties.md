Each character position in a buffer or a string can have a *text property list*, much like the property list of a symbol (see [Property Lists](Property-Lists)). The properties belong to a particular character at a particular place, such as, the letter ‘`T`’ at the beginning of this sentence or the first ‘`o`’ in ‘`foo`’—if the same character occurs in two different places, the two occurrences in general have different properties.

Each property has a name and a value. Both of these can be any Lisp object, but the name is normally a symbol. Typically each property name symbol is used for a particular purpose; for instance, the text property `face` specifies the faces for displaying the character (see [Special Properties](Special-Properties)). The usual way to access the property list is to specify a name and ask what value corresponds to it.

If a character has a `category` property, we call it the *property category* of the character. It should be a symbol. The properties of the symbol serve as defaults for the properties of the character.

Copying text between strings and buffers preserves the properties along with the characters; this includes such diverse functions as `substring`, `insert`, and `buffer-substring`.

slug: Special-Read-Syntax
---

Emacs Lisp represents many special objects and constructs via special hash notations.

### ‘`#<…>`’

Objects that have no read syntax are presented like this (see [Printed Representation](/docs/elisp/Printed-Representation)).

### ‘`##`’

The printed representation of an interned symbol whose name is an empty string (see [Symbol Type](/docs/elisp/Symbol-Type)).

### ‘`#'`’

This is a shortcut for `function`, see [Anonymous Functions](/docs/elisp/Anonymous-Functions).

### ‘`#:`’

The printed representation of an uninterned symbol whose name is `foo` is ‘`#:foo`’ (see [Symbol Type](/docs/elisp/Symbol-Type)).

### ‘`#N`’

When printing circular structures, this construct is used to represent where the structure loops back onto itself, and ‘`N`’ is the starting list count:

```lisp
(let ((a (list 1)))
  (setcdr a a))
=> (1 . #0)
```

### ‘`#N=`’

### ‘`#N#`’

‘`#N=`’ gives the name to an object, and ‘`#N#`’ represents that object, so when reading back the object, they will be the same object instead of copies (see [Circular Objects](/docs/elisp/Circular-Objects)).

### ‘`#xN`’

‘`N`’ represented as a hexadecimal number (‘`#x2a`’).

### ‘`#oN`’

‘`N`’ represented as an octal number (‘`#o52`’).

### ‘`#bN`’

‘`N`’ represented as a binary number (‘`#b101010`’).

### ‘`#(…)`’

String text properties (see [Text Props and Strings](/docs/elisp/Text-Props-and-Strings)).

### ‘`#^`’

A char table (see [Char-Table Type](/docs/elisp/Char_002dTable-Type)).

### ‘`#s(hash-table …)`’

A hash table (see [Hash Table Type](/docs/elisp/Hash-Table-Type)).

### ‘`?C`’

A character (see [Basic Char Syntax](/docs/elisp/Basic-Char-Syntax)).

### ‘`#$`’

The current file name in byte-compiled files (see [Docs and Compilation](/docs/elisp/Docs-and-Compilation)). This is not meant to be used in Emacs Lisp source files.

### ‘`#@N`’

Skip the next ‘`N`’ characters (see [Comments](/docs/elisp/Comments)). This is used in byte-compiled files, and is not meant to be used in Emacs Lisp source files.

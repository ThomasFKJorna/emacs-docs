There are two general categories of types in Emacs Lisp: those having to do with Lisp programming, and those having to do with editing. The former exist in many Lisp implementations, in one form or another. The latter are unique to Emacs Lisp.

|                                                      |    |                                                                                                      |
| :--------------------------------------------------- | -- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| • [Integer Type](Integer-Type)                       |    | Numbers without fractional parts.                                                                    |

| • [Macro Type](Macro-Type)                           |    | A method of expanding an expression into another expression, more fundamental but less pretty.       |
| • [Primitive Function Type](Primitive-Function-Type) |    | A function written in C, callable from Lisp.                                                         |
| • [Byte-Code Type](Byte_002dCode-Type)               |    | A function written in Lisp, then compiled.                                                           |

AUCTeX supports the standard outline minor mode using LaTeX/ConTeXt sectioning commands as header lines. See [(emacs)Outline Mode](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Outline-Mode) section ‘Outline Mode’ in GNU Emacs Manual.

You can add your own headings by setting the variable `TeX-outline-extra`.

### <span className="tag variable">`variable`</span> **TeX-outline-extra**

List of extra TeX outline levels.

Each element is a list with two entries. The first entry is the regular expression matching a header, and the second is the level of the header. A ‘`^`’ is automatically prepended to the regular expressions in the list, so they must match text at the beginning of the line.

See `LaTeX-section-list` or `ConTeXt-INTERFACE-section-list` for existing header levels.

The following example add ‘`\item`’ and ‘`\bibliography`’ headers, with ‘`\bibliography`’ at the same outline level as ‘`\section`’, and ‘`\item`’ being below ‘`\subparagraph`’.

```lisp
(setq TeX-outline-extra       '(("[ \t]*\\\\\\(bib\\)?item\\b" 7) 	("\\\\bibliography\\b" 2))) 
```

You may want to check out the unbundled ‘`out-xtra`’ package for even better outline support. It is available from your favorite emacs lisp archive.

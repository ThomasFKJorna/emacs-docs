slug: Verbatim-content

Usually it is not desirable to have content to be typeset verbatim highlighted according to LaTeX syntax. Therefore this content will be fontified uniformly with the face `font-latex-verbatim-face`.

font-latex differentiates three different types of verbatim constructs for fontification. Macros with special characters like | as delimiters, macros with braces, and environments. Which macros and environments are recognized is controlled by the variables `LaTeX-verbatim-macros-with-delims`, `LaTeX-verbatim-macros-with-braces`, and `LaTeX-verbatim-environments` respectively.

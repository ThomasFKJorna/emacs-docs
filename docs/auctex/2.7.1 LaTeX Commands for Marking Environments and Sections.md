### <span className="tag command">`command`</span> **LaTeX-mark-section**

(`C-c *`) Set mark at end of current logical section, and point at top.

With a non-nil prefix argument, mark only the region from the current section start to the next sectioning command. Thereby subsections are not being marked. Otherwise, any included subsections are also marked along with current section.

### <span className="tag command">`command`</span> **LaTeX-mark-environment**

(`C-c .`) Set mark to the end of the current environment and point to the matching beginning.

If a prefix argument is given, mark the respective number of enclosing environments. The command will not work properly if there are unbalanced begin-end pairs in comments and verbatim environments.

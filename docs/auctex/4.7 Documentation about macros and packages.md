(`C-c ?`) Get documentation about the packages installed on your system, using ‘`texdoc`’ to find the manuals. The function will prompt for the name of packages. If point is on a word, this will be suggested as default.

If the command is called with a prefix argument, you will be shown a list of manuals of the given package among to choose.

The command can be invoked by the key binding mentioned above as well as the ‘`Find Documentation...`’ entry in the mode menu.

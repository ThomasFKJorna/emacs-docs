Running TeX or LaTeX will only find regular errors in the document, not examples of bad style. Furthermore, description of the errors may often be confusing. The utilities `lacheck` and `chktex` can be used to find style errors, such as forgetting to escape the space after an abbreviation or using ‘`...`’ instead of ‘`\ldots`’ and other similar problems. You start `lacheck` with `C-c C-c Check <RET>` and `chktex` with `C-c C-c ChkTeX <RET>`. The result will be a list of errors in the ‘`*compilation*`’ buffer. You can go through the errors with `` C-x ` `` (`next-error`, see [(emacs)Compilation](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Compilation) section ‘Compilation’ in The Emacs Editor), which will move point to the location of the next error.

Alternatively, you may want in-buffer notation. AUCTeX provides support for this using the Flymake package in Emacs 26 or newer (See [(Flymake)Using Flymake](Using-Flymake) section ‘Using Flymake’ in GNU Flymake for details). To enable, call `M-x flymake-mode RET` in the buffer or enable it in all buffers by adding this to your init file:

```lisp
(add-hook 'LaTeX-mode-hook #'flymake-mode) 
```

Note that AUCTeX currently only provides support for using `chktex` as the flymake backend.

Each of the two utilities `lacheck` and `chktex` will find some errors the other doesn’t, but `chktex` is more configurable, allowing you to create your own errors. You may need to install the programs before using them. You can get `lacheck` from ‘`<URL:https://www.ctan.org/pkg/lacheck>`’ and `chktex` from ‘`<URL:https://www.ctan.org/pkg/chktex>`’.

*   GNU Emacs 24 or higher

    Using preview-latex requires a version of Emacs compiled with image support.

    ### **Windows**

    Precompiled versions are available from [https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/](https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/).

    ### **macOS**

    For an overview of precompiled versions of Emacs for macOS see for example [https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsForMacOS](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/EmacsForMacOS).

    ### **GNU/Linux**

    Most GNU/Linux distributions nowadays provide a recent variant of Emacs via their package repositories.

    ### **Self-compiled**

    Compiling Emacs yourself requires a C compiler and a number of tools and development libraries. Details are beyond the scope of this manual. Instructions for checking out the source code can be found at [https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=emacs](https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=emacs).

*   A working TeX installation

    Well, AUCTeX would be pointless without that. Processing documentation requires TeX, LaTeX and Texinfo during installation. preview-latex requires Dvips for its operation in DVI mode. The default configuration of AUCTeX is tailored for teTeX or TeXlive-based distributions, but can be adapted easily.

*   A recent Ghostscript

    This is needed for operation of preview-latex in both DVI and PDF mode. Most versions of Ghostscript nowadays in use should work fine (version 7.0 and newer).

*   GNU make

    Recent AUCTeX uses GNU make specific capabilities in the Makefiles. If your OS’s default `make` command is not GNU make, you have to obtain it in order to build AUCTeX by yourself. GNU make is sometimes provided under the name `gmake` in your OS’s binary package system.

*   The `texinfo` package

    Strictly speaking, you can get away without it if you are building from the distribution tarball, have not modified any files and don’t need a printed version of the manual: the pregenerated info file is included in the tarball. At least version 4.0 is required.

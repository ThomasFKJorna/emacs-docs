In an itemize-like environment, nodes (i.e., ‘`\item`’s) may be inserted using `C-c <LFD>`.

### <span className="tag command">`command`</span> **LaTeX-insert-item**

(`C-c <LFD>`) Close the current item, move to the next line and insert an appropriate ‘`\item`’ for the current environment. That is, ‘itemize’ and ‘enumerate’ will have ‘`\item `’ inserted, while ‘description’ will have ‘`\item[]`’ inserted.

### <span className="tag useroption">`user option`</span> **TeX-arg-item-label-p**

If non-nil, you will always be asked for optional label in items. Otherwise, you will be asked only in description environments.

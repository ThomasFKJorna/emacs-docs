slug: Prettifying

Emacs 25 is able to prettify symbols in programming language buffers, see [(emacs)Misc for Programs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Misc-for-Programs) section ‘Misc for Programs’ in GNU Emacs Manual. The canonical example is to display `(lambda () ...)` as `(λ () ...)` in Lisp buffers.

AUCTeX can use this feature in order to display certain math macros and greek letters using their Unicode representation, too. For example, the TeX code `\alpha \times \beta` will be displayed as `α × β`. When point is on one of the characters, it’ll be unprettified automatically, meaning you see the verbatim text again. For this behaviour however you need to set `prettify-symbols-unprettify-at-point` to t or `right-edge` which will unprettify the symbol when point moves into or near it.

To enable prettification in AUCTeX, simply add `prettify-symbols-mode` to `TeX-mode-hook`. If you enabled prettification globally with `global-prettify-symbols-mode`, then it’s automatically enabled in AUCTeX, too.

You can also add custom symbol unicode-character pairs for prettification by adding to `tex--prettify-symbols-alist`. Note that this variable is part of Emacs’ stock `tex-mode.el` and used by that and AUCTeX.

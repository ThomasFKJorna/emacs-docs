Text in quotation marks is displayed with the face `font-latex-string-face`. Besides the various forms of opening and closing double and single quotation marks, so-called guillemets (﹤﹤, ﹥﹥) can be used for quoting. Because there are two styles of using them—French style: ﹤﹤ text ﹥﹥; German style: ﹥﹥text﹤﹤—you can customize the variable `font-latex-quotes` to tell font-latex which type you are using if the correct value cannot be derived from document properties.

### <span className="tag useroption">`user option`</span> **font-latex-quotes**

The default value of `font-latex-quotes` is ‘`auto`’ which means that font-latex will try to derive the correct type of quotation mark matching from document properties like the language option supplied to the babel LaTeX package.

If the automatic detection fails for you and you mostly use one specific style you can set it to a specific language-dependent value as well. Set the value to ‘`german`’ if you are using ﹥﹥German quotes﹤﹤ and to ‘`french`’ if you are using ﹤﹤ French quotes ﹥﹥. font-latex will recognize the different ways these quotes can be given in your source code, i.e. (‘`"<`’, ‘`">`’), (‘`<<`’, ‘`>>`’) and the respective 8-bit variants.

If you set `font-latex-quotes` to nil, quoted content will not be fontified.

AUCTeX includes a major mode for editting Texinfo files. This major mode is not the same mode as the native Texinfo mode (see [(texinfo)Texinfo Mode](/docs/auctex/Texinfo-Mode)) of Emacs, although they have the same name. However, AUCTeX still relies on a number of functions from the native Texinfo mode.

The following text describes which functionality is offered by AUCTeX and which by the native Texinfo mode. This should enable you to decide when to consult the AUCTeX manual and when the manual of the native mode. And in case you are a seasoned user of the native mode, the information should help you to swiftly get to know the AUCTeX-specific commands.

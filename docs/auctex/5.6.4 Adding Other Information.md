You can also specify bibliographical databases and labels in the style file. This is probably of little use, since this information will usually be automatically generated from the TeX file anyway.

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **LaTeX-add-bibliographies*** `bibliography` …*

Add each `bibliography` to list of loaded bibliographies.

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **LaTeX-add-labels*** `label` …*

Add each `label` to the list of known labels.

AUCTeX can update the style information about a file each time you save it, and it will do this if the directory `TeX-auto-local` exists. `TeX-auto-local` is by default set to ‘`"auto"`’, so simply creating an ‘`auto`’ directory will enable automatic saving of style information.

The advantage of doing this is that macros, labels, etc. defined in any file in a multifile document will be known in all the files in the document. The disadvantage is that saving will be slower. To disable, set `TeX-auto-local` to nil.

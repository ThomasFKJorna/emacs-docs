The most powerful features of AUCTeX may be those allowing you to run TeX, LaTeX, ConTeXt and other external commands like BibTeX and `makeindex` from within Emacs, viewing and printing the results, and moreover allowing you to *debug* your documents.

AUCTeX comes with a special tool bar for TeX and LaTeX which provides buttons for the most important commands. You can enable or disable it by customizing the options `plain-TeX-enable-toolbar` and `LaTeX-enable-toolbar` in the `TeX-tool-bar` customization group.

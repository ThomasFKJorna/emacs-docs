### <span className="tag command">`command`</span> **Texinfo-mark-section**

(`C-c *`) Mark the current section, with inclusion of any containing node.

The current section is detected as starting by any of the structuring commands matched by the regular expression in the variable `outline-regexp` which in turn is a regular expression matching any element of the variable `texinfo-section-list`.

With a non-nil prefix argument, mark only the region from the current section start to the next sectioning command. Thereby subsections are not being marked. Otherwise, any included subsections are also marked

Note that when the current section is starting immediately after a node command, then the node command is also marked as part of the section.

### <span className="tag command">`command`</span> **Texinfo-mark-environment**

(`C-c .`) Set mark to the end of the current environment and point to the matching beginning.

If a prefix argument is given, mark the respective number of enclosing environments. The command will not work properly if there are unbalanced begin-end pairs in comments and verbatim environments.

### <span className="tag command">`command`</span> **Texinfo-mark-node**

(`M-C-h`) Mark the current node. This is the node in which point is located. It is starting at the previous occurrence of the keyword `@node` and ending at next occurrence of the keywords `@node` or `@bye`.

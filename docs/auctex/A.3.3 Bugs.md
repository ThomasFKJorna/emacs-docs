*   The style hooks automatically generated by parsing files for ‘`example.dtx`’, ‘`example.sty`’, ‘`example.drv`’ and ‘`example.bib`’ all clash. Bad. Clash with hand-written style hooks should be removed by dialect discrimination — to be checked.
*   `` C-c ` `` should always stay in the current window, also when it finds a new file.
*   Do not overwrite emacs warnings about existing auto-save files when loading a new file.
*   Maybe the regexp for matching a TeX symbol during parsing should be ‘`"\\\\\\([a-zA-Z]+\\|.\\)"`’ — ‘`<thiemann@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de>`’ Peter Thiemann.
*   AUCTeX should not parse verbatim environments.
*   Make ‘`` ` ``’ check for math context in `LaTeX-math-mode`. and simply self insert if not in a math context.
*   Make `TeX-insert-dollar` more robust. Currently it can be fooled by ‘`\mbox`’’es and escaped double dollar for example.
*   Correct indentation for tabular, tabbing, table, math, and array environments.

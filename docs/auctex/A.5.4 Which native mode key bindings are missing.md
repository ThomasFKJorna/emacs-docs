The following commands from the native commands might still be useful when working with AUCTeX, however, they are not accessible with a key binding any longer.

### `@node` insertion

The node insertion command, mapped to `C-c C-c n` in the native mode, is not mapped to any key in AUCTeX. You can still access it through the Texinfo menu, though. Another alternative is to use the `C-c C-m` binding for macro insertion in AUCTeX.

### Show the section structure

The command `texinfo-show-structure` (`C-c C-s`) from the native mode does not have a key binding in AUCTeX. The binding is used by AUCTeX for sectioning.

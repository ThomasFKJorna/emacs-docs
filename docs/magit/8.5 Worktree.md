### `Z c`     (`magit-worktree-branch`)

Create a new BRANCH and check it out in a new worktree at PATH.

### `Z m`     (`magit-worktree-move`)

Move an existing worktree to a new PATH.

### `Z k`     (`magit-worktree-delete`)

Delete a worktree, defaulting to the worktree at point. The primary worktree cannot be deleted.

### `Z g`     (`magit-worktree-status`)

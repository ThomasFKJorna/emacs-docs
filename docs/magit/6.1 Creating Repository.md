### `I`     (`magit-init`)

This command initializes a repository and then shows the status buffer for the new repository.

If the directory is below an existing repository, then the user has to confirm that a new one should be created inside. If the directory is the root of the existing repository, then the user has to confirm that it should be reinitialized.

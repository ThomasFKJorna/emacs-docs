### `w`     (`magit-am`)

This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands along with the appropriate infix arguments and displays them in a temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

### `w w`     (`magit-am-apply-patches`)

This command applies one or more patches. If the region marks files, then those are applied as patches. Otherwise this command reads a file-name in the minibuffer, defaulting to the file at point.

### `w m`     (`magit-am-apply-maildir`)

This command applies patches from a maildir.

### `w a`     (`magit-patch-apply`)

This command applies a plain patch. For a longer description see [Plain Patches](/docs/magit/Plain-Patches). This command is only available from the `magit-am` transient for historic reasons.

When an "am" operation is in progress, then the transient instead features the following suffix commands.

### `w w`     (`magit-am-continue`)

This command resumes the current patch applying sequence.

### `w s`     (`magit-am-skip`)

This command skips the stopped at patch during a patch applying sequence.

### `w a`     (`magit-am-abort`)

This command aborts the current patch applying sequence. This discards all changes made since the sequence started.

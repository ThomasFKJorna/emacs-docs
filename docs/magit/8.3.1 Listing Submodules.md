The command `magit-list-submodules` displays a list of the current repository’s submodules in a separate buffer. It’s also possible to display information about submodules directly in the status buffer of the super-repository by adding `magit-insert-modules` to the hook `magit-status-sections-hook` as described in [Status Module Sections](Status-Module-Sections).

### <span className="tag command">`command`</span> **magit-list-submodules**

This command displays a list of the current repository’s submodules in a separate buffer.

It can be invoked by pressing `RET` on the section titled "Modules".

### <span className="tag useroption">`user option`</span> **magit-submodule-list-columns**

This option controls what columns are displayed by the command `magit-list-submodules` and how they are displayed.

Each element has the form `(HEADER WIDTH FORMAT PROPS)`.

HEADER is the string displayed in the header. WIDTH is the width of the column. FORMAT is a function that is called with one argument, the repository identification (usually its basename), and with `default-directory` bound to the toplevel of its working tree. It has to return a string to be inserted or nil. PROPS is an alist that supports the keys `:right-align` and `:pad-right`.

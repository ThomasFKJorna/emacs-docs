Also see the [git-reflog(1)](http://git-scm.com/docs/git-reflog) manpage.

These reflog commands are available from the log transient. See [Logging](Logging).

### `l r`     (`magit-reflog-current`)

Display the reflog of the current branch.

### `l O`     (`magit-reflog-other`)

Display the reflog of a branch or another ref.

### `l H`     (`magit-reflog-head`)

Display the `HEAD` reflog.

### <span className="tag useroption">`user option`</span> **magit-reflog-margin**

This option specifies whether the margin is initially shown in Magit-Reflog mode buffers and how it is formatted.

The value has the form `(INIT STYLE WIDTH AUTHOR AUTHOR-WIDTH)`.

*   If INIT is non-nil, then the margin is shown initially.
*   STYLE controls how to format the author or committer date. It can be one of `age` (to show the age of the commit), `age-abbreviated` (to abbreviate the time unit to a character), or a string (suitable for `format-time-string`) to show the actual date. Option `magit-log-margin-show-committer-date` controls which date is being displayed.
*   WIDTH controls the width of the margin. This exists for forward compatibility and currently the value should not be changed.
*   AUTHOR controls whether the name of the author is also shown by default.
*   AUTHOR-WIDTH has to be an integer. When the name of the author is shown, then this specifies how much space is used to do so.

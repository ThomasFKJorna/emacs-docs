slug: Committing
---

When the user initiates a commit, Magit calls `git commit` without any arguments, so Git has to get it from the user. It creates the file `.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG` and then opens that file in an editor. Magit arranges for that editor to be the Emacsclient. Once the user finishes the editing session, the Emacsclient exits and Git creates the commit using the file’s content as message.

### `W`     (`magit-patch`)

This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands along with the appropriate infix arguments and displays them in a temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

### `W c`     (`magit-patch-create`)

This command creates patches for a set commits. If the region marks several commits, then it creates patches for all of them. Otherwise it functions as a transient prefix command, which features several infix arguments and binds itself as a suffix command. When this command is invoked as a suffix of itself, then it creates a patch using the specified infix arguments.

### `w a`     (`magit-patch-apply`)

This command applies a patch. This is a transient prefix command, which features several infix arguments and binds itself as a suffix command. When this command is invoked as a suffix of itself, then it applies a patch using the specified infix arguments.

### `W s`     (`magit-patch-save`)

This command creates a patch from the current diff.

Inside `magit-diff-mode` or `magit-revision-mode` buffers, `C-x C-w` is also bound to this command.

It is also possible to save a plain patch file by using `C-x C-w` inside a `magit-diff-mode` or `magit-revision-mode` buffer.

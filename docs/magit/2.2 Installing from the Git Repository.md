Magit depends on the `dash`, `transient` and `with-editor` libraries which are available from Melpa and Melpa-Stable. Install them using `M-x package-install RET <package> RET`. Of course you may also install them manually from their repository.

Then clone the Magit repository:

```lisp
$ git clone https://github.com/magit/magit.git ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/magit
$ cd ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/magit
```

Then compile the libraries and generate the info manuals:

```lisp
$ make
```

If you havenâ€™t installed `dash`, `transient` and `with-editor` from Melpa or at `/path/to/magit/../<package>`, then you have to tell `make` where to find them. To do so create the file `/path/to/magit/config.mk` with the following content before running `make`:

```lisp
LOAD_PATH  = -L ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/magit/lisp
LOAD_PATH += -L ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/dash
LOAD_PATH += -L ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/transient/lisp
LOAD_PATH += -L ~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/with-editor
```

Finally add this to your init file:

```lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/magit/lisp")
(require 'magit)

(with-eval-after-load 'info
  (info-initialize)
  (add-to-list 'Info-directory-list
               "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/magit/Documentation/"))
```

Of course if you installed the dependencies manually as well, then you have to tell Emacs about them too, by prefixing the above with:

```lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/dash")
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/transient/lisp")
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/site-lisp/with-editor")
```

Note that you have to add the `lisp` subdirectory to the `load-path`, not the top-level of the repository, and that elements of `load-path` should not end with a slash, while those of `Info-directory-list` should.

Instead of requiring the feature `magit`, you could load just the autoload definitions, by loading the file `magit-autoloads.el`.

```lisp
(load "/path/to/magit/lisp/magit-autoloads")
```

Instead of running Magit directly from the repository by adding that to the `load-path`, you might want to instead install it in some other directory using `sudo make install` and setting `load-path` accordingly.

To update Magit use:

```lisp
$ git pull
$ make
```

At times it might be necessary to run `make clean all` instead.

To view all available targets use `make help`.

### <span className="tag useroption">`user option`</span> **magit-list-refs-sortby**

For many commands that read a ref or refs from the user, the value of this option can be used to control the order of the refs. Valid values include any key accepted by the `--sort` flag of `git for-each-ref`. By default, refs are sorted alphabetically by their full name (e.g., "refs/heads/master").

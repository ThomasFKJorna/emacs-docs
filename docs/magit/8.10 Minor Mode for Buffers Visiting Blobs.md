slug: Minor-Mode-for-Buffers-Visiting-Blobs
---

The `magit-blob-mode` enables certain Magit features in blob-visiting buffers. Such buffers can be created using `magit-find-file` and some of the commands mentioned below, which also take care of turning on this minor mode. Currently this mode only establishes a few key bindings, but this might be extended.

### `p`     (`magit-blob-previous`)

Visit the previous blob which modified the current file.

### `n`     (`magit-blob-next`)

Visit the next blob which modified the current file.

### `q`     (`magit-kill-this-buffer`)

Kill the current buffer.

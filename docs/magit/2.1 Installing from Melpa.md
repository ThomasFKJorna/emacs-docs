Magit is available from Melpa and Melpa-Stable. If you haven’t used Emacs’ package manager before, then it is high time you familiarize yourself with it by reading the documentation in the Emacs manual, see [(emacs)Packages](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Packages). Then add one of the archives to `package-archives`:

*   To use Melpa:

```lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa" . "http://melpa.org/packages/") t)
```

*   To use Melpa-Stable:

```lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives
             '("melpa-stable" . "http://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)
```

Once you have added your preferred archive, you need to update the local package list using:

```lisp
M-x package-refresh-contents RET
```

Once you have done that, you can install Magit and its dependencies using:

```lisp
M-x package-install RET magit RET
```

### `V`     (`magit-revert`)

This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands along with the appropriate infix arguments and displays them in a temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

When no cherry-pick or revert is in progress, then the transient features the following suffix commands.

### `V V`     (`magit-revert-and-commit`)

Revert a commit by creating a new commit. Prompt for a commit, defaulting to the commit at point. If the region selects multiple commits, then revert all of them, without prompting.

### `V v`     (`magit-revert-no-commit`)

Revert a commit by applying it in reverse to the working tree. Prompt for a commit, defaulting to the commit at point. If the region selects multiple commits, then revert all of them, without prompting.

When a cherry-pick or revert is in progress, then the transient instead features the following suffix commands.

### `V A`     (`magit-sequence-continue`)

Resume the current cherry-pick or revert sequence.

### `V s`     (`magit-sequence-skip`)

Skip the stopped at commit during a cherry-pick or revert sequence.

### `V a`     (`magit-sequence-abort`)

Abort the current cherry-pick or revert sequence. This discards all changes made since the sequence started.

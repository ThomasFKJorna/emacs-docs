The transient prefix command `magit-log-refresh`, on `L`, can be used to change the log arguments used in the current buffer, without changing which log is shown. This works in dedicated log buffers, but also in the status buffer.

### `L`     (`magit-log-refresh`)

This transient prefix command binds the following suffix commands along with the appropriate infix arguments and displays them in a temporary buffer until a suffix is invoked.

### `L g`     (`magit-log-refresh`)

This suffix command sets the local log arguments for the current buffer.

### `L s`     (`magit-log-set-default-arguments`)

This suffix command sets the default log arguments for buffers of the same type as that of the current buffer. Other existing buffers of the same type are not affected because their local values have already been initialized.

### `L w`     (`magit-log-save-default-arguments`)

This suffix command sets the default log arguments for buffers of the same type as that of the current buffer, and saves the value for future sessions. Other existing buffers of the same type are not affected because their local values have already been initialized.

### `L t`     (`magit-toggle-margin`)

Show or hide the margin.

Many Magit commands are implemented as **transient** commands. First the user invokes a **prefix** command, which causes its **infix** arguments and **suffix** commands to be displayed in the echo area. The user then optionally sets some infix arguments and finally invokes one of the suffix commands.

This is implemented in the library `transient`. Earlier Magit releases used the package `magit-popup` and even earlier versions library `magit-key-mode`.

Transient is documented in [(transient)Top](https://magit.vc/manual/transient.html#Top).

### `C-c C-c`     (`magit-dispatch`)

This transient prefix command binds most of Magit’s other prefix commands as suffix commands and displays them in a temporary buffer until one of them is invoked. Invoking such a sub-prefix causes the suffixes of that command to be bound and displayed instead of those of `magit-dispatch`.

This command is also, or especially, useful outside Magit buffers, so you should setup a global binding:

```lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-x M-g") 'magit-dispatch)
```

After installing Magit you should verify that you are indeed using the Magit, Git, and Emacs releases you think you are using. Itâ€™s best to restart Emacs before doing so, to make sure you are not using an outdated value for `load-path`.

```lisp
M-x magit-version RET
```

should display something like

```lisp
Magit 2.8.0, Git 2.10.2, Emacs 25.1.1, gnu/linux
```

Then you might also want to read about options that many users likely want to customize. See [Essential Settings](/docs/magit/Essential-Settings).

To be able to follow cross references to Git manpages found in this manual, you might also have to manually install the `gitman` info manual, or advice `Info-follow-nearest-node` to instead open the actual manpage. See [How to install the gitman info manual?](/docs/magit/How-to-install-the-gitman-info-manual_003f).

If you are completely new to Magit then see [Getting Started](/docs/magit/Getting-Started).

If you run into problems, then please see the [FAQ](/docs/magit/FAQ). Also see the [Debugging Tools](/docs/magit/Debugging-Tools).

And last but not least please consider making a donation, to ensure that I can keep working on Magit. See [https://magit.vc/donations](https://magit.vc/donations). for various donation options.

The contents of references buffers is controlled using the hook `magit-refs-sections-hook`. See [Section Hooks](Section-Hooks) to learn about such hooks and how to customize them. All of the below functions are members of the default value. Note that it makes much less sense to customize this hook than it does for the respective hook used for the status buffer.

### <span className="tag useroption">`user option`</span> **magit-refs-sections-hook**

Hook run to insert sections into a references buffer.

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **magit-insert-local-branches**

Insert sections showing all local branches.

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **magit-insert-remote-branches**

Insert sections showing all remote-tracking branches.

### <span className="tag function">`function`</span> **magit-insert-tags**

Insert sections showing all tags.

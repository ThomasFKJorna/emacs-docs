slug: Term-Mode
---

To switch between line and char mode in Term mode, use these commands:

### `C-c C-j`

Switch to line mode (`term-line-mode`). Do nothing if already in line mode.

### `C-c C-k`

Switch to char mode (`term-char-mode`). Do nothing if already in char mode.

The following commands are only available in char mode:

### `C-c C-c`

Send a literal `C-c` to the sub-shell (`term-interrupt-subjob`).

### `C-c char`

This is equivalent to `C-x char` in normal Emacs. For example, `C-c o` invokes the global binding of `C-x o`, which is normally ‘`other-window`’.

Term mode has a page-at-a-time feature. When enabled, it makes output pause at the end of each screenful:

### `C-c C-q`

Toggle the page-at-a-time feature (`term-pager-toggle`). This command works in both line and char modes. When the feature is enabled, the mode-line displays the word ‘`page`’, and each time Term receives more than a screenful of output, it pauses and displays ‘`**MORE**`’ in the mode-line. Type `SPC` to display the next screenful of output, or `?` to see your other options. The interface is similar to the `more` program.

slug: Menu-Mouse-Clicks
---

Several mouse clicks with the `Ctrl` and `SHIFT` modifiers bring up menus.

### `C-mouse-1`

This menu is for selecting a buffer.

The MSB (“mouse select buffer") global minor mode makes this menu smarter and more customizable. See [Buffer Menus](Buffer-Menus).

### `C-mouse-2`

This menu contains entries for examining faces and other text properties, and well as for setting them (the latter is mainly useful when editing enriched text; see [Enriched Text](Enriched-Text)).

### `C-mouse-3`

This menu is mode-specific. For most modes if Menu-bar mode is on, this menu has the same items as all the mode-specific menu-bar menus put together. Some modes may specify a different menu for this button. If Menu Bar mode is off, this menu contains all the items which would be present in the menu bar—not just the mode-specific ones—so that you can access them without having to display the menu bar.

### `S-mouse-1`

This menu is for changing the default face within the window’s buffer. See [Text Scale](Text-Scale).

Some graphical applications use `mouse-3` for a mode-specific menu. If you prefer `mouse-3` in Emacs to bring up such a menu instead of running the `mouse-save-then-kill` command, rebind `mouse-3` by adding the following line to your init file (see [Init Rebinding](Init-Rebinding)):

```lisp
(global-set-key [mouse-3] 'mouse-popup-menubar-stuff)
```

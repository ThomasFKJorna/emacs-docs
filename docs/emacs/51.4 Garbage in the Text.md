If `C-l` shows that the text is wrong, first type `C-h l` (`view-lossage`) to see what commands you typed to produce the observed results. Then try undoing the changes step by step using `C-x u` (`undo`), until it gets back to a state you consider correct.

If a large portion of text appears to be missing at the beginning or end of the buffer, check for the word ‘`Narrow`’ in the mode line. If it appears, the text you don’t see is probably still present, but temporarily off-limits. To make it accessible again, type `C-x n w` (`widen`). See [Narrowing](Narrowing).

slug: Cell-Justification
---

The command `M-x table-justify` imposes *justification* on one or more cells in a text-based table. Justification determines how the text in the cell is aligned, relative to the edges of the cell. Each cell in a table can be separately justified.

`M-x table-justify` first prompts for what to justify; the options are ‘`cell`’ (just the current cell), ‘`column`’ (all cells in the current table column) and ‘`row`’ (all cells in the current table row). The command then prompts for the justification style; the options are `left`, `center`, `right`, `top`, `middle`, `bottom`, or `none` (meaning no vertical justification).

Horizontal and vertical justification styles are specified independently, and both types can be in effect simultaneously; for instance, you can call `M-x table-justify` twice, once to specify `right` justification and once to specify `bottom` justification, to align the contents of a cell to the bottom right.

The justification style is stored in the buffer as a text property, and is lost when you kill the buffer or exit Emacs. However, the table recognition commands, such as `M-x table-recognize` (see [Table Recognition](/docs/emacs/Table-Recognition)), attempt to determine and re-apply each cell’s justification style, by examining its contents. To disable this feature, change the variable `table-detect-cell-alignment` to `nil`.

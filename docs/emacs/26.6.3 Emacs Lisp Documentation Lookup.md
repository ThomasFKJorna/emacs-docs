slug: Lisp-Doc

When editing Emacs Lisp code, you can use the commands `C-h f` (`describe-function`) and `C-h v` (`describe-variable`) to view the built-in documentation for the Lisp functions and variables that you want to use. See [Name Help](/docs/emacs/Name-Help).

ElDoc is a buffer-local minor mode that helps with looking up Lisp documentation. When it is enabled, the echo area displays some useful information whenever there is a Lisp function or variable at point; for a function, it shows the argument list, and for a variable it shows the first line of the variable’s documentation string. To toggle ElDoc mode, type `M-x eldoc-mode`. There’s also a Global ElDoc mode, which is turned on by default, and affects buffers, such as ‘`*scratch*`’, whose major mode is Emacs Lisp or Lisp Interaction (`M-x global-eldoc-mode`<!-- /@w --> to turn it off globally).

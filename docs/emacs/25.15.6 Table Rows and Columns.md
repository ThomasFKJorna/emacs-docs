`M-x table-insert-row` inserts a row of cells before the current table row. The current row, together with point, is pushed down past the new row. To insert a row after the last row at the bottom of a table, invoke this command with point below the table, just below the bottom edge. You can insert more than one row at a time by using a numeric prefix argument.

Similarly, `M-x table-insert-column` inserts a column of cells to the left of the current table column. To insert a column to the right side of the rightmost column, invoke this command with point to the right of the rightmost column, outside the table. A numeric prefix argument specifies the number of columns to insert.

`M-x table-delete-column` deletes the column of cells at point. Similarly, `M-x table-delete-row` deletes the row of cells at point. A numeric prefix argument to either command specifies the number of columns or rows to delete.

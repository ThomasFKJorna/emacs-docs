This chapter describes Emacs features for maintaining medium- to large-size programs and packages. These features include:

*   \- Unified interface to Support for Version Control Systems (VCS) that record the history of changes to source files.
*   \- Commands for handling programming projects.
*   \- A specialized mode for maintaining `ChangeLog` files that provide a chronological log of program changes.
*   \- Xref, a set of commands for displaying definitions of symbols (a.k.a. “identifiers") and their references.
*   \- EDE, the Emacs’s own IDE.
*   \- A mode for merging changes to program sources made on separate branches of development.

If you are maintaining a large Lisp program, then in addition to the features described here, you may find the Emacs Lisp Regression Testing (ERT) library useful (see [ERT](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/ert.html#Top) in Emacs Lisp Regression Testing).

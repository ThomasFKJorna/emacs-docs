You can use the other supported calendars to specify a date to move to. This section describes the commands for doing this using calendars other than Mayan; for the Mayan calendar, see the following section.

### `g c`

Move to a date specified in the ISO commercial calendar (`calendar-iso-goto-date`).

### `g w`

Move to a week specified in the ISO commercial calendar (`calendar-iso-goto-week`).

### `g j`

Move to a date specified in the Julian calendar (`calendar-julian-goto-date`).

### `g a`

Move to a date specified with an astronomical (Julian) day number (`calendar-astro-goto-day-number`).

### `g b`

Move to a date specified in the Bahá’í calendar (`calendar-bahai-goto-date`).

### `g h`

Move to a date specified in the Hebrew calendar (`calendar-hebrew-goto-date`).

### `g i`

Move to a date specified in the Islamic calendar (`calendar-islamic-goto-date`).

### `g f`

Move to a date specified in the French Revolutionary calendar (`calendar-french-goto-date`).

### `g C`

Move to a date specified in the Chinese calendar (`calendar-chinese-goto-date`).

### `g p`

Move to a date specified in the Persian calendar (`calendar-persian-goto-date`).

### `g k`

Move to a date specified in the Coptic calendar (`calendar-coptic-goto-date`).

### `g e`

Move to a date specified in the Ethiopic calendar (`calendar-ethiopic-goto-date`).

These commands ask you for a date on the other calendar, move point to the Gregorian calendar date equivalent to that date, and display the other calendar’s date in the echo area. Emacs uses strict completion (see [Completion Exit](/docs/emacs/Completion-Exit)) whenever it asks you to type a month name, so you don’t have to worry about the spelling of Hebrew, Islamic, or French names.

One common issue concerning the Hebrew calendar is the computation of the anniversary of a date of death, called a *yahrzeit*. The Emacs calendar includes a facility for such calculations. If you are in the calendar, the command `M-x calendar-hebrew-list-yahrzeits` asks you for a range of years and then displays a list of the yahrzeit dates for those years for the date given by point. If you are not in the calendar, this command first asks you for the date of death and the range of years, and then displays the list of yahrzeit dates.

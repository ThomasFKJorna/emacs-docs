When Rmail displays a message that does not fit on the screen, you must scroll through it to read the rest. You could do this with the usual scrolling commands: `C-v`, `M-v` and `M-<` (see [Scrolling](Scrolling)), but in Rmail scrolling is so frequent that it deserves to be easier.

### `SPC`

Scroll forward (`scroll-up-command`).

### `DEL`

### `S-SPC`

Scroll backward (`scroll-down-command`).

### `.`

Scroll to start of message (`rmail-beginning-of-message`).

### `/`

Scroll to end of message (`rmail-end-of-message`).

Since the most common thing to do while reading a message is to scroll through it by screenfuls, Rmail makes `SPC` and `DEL` (or `S-SPC`) do the same as `C-v` (`scroll-up-command`) and `M-v` (`scroll-down-command`) respectively.

The command `.` (`rmail-beginning-of-message`) scrolls back to the beginning of the selected message. This is not quite the same as `M-<`: for one thing, it does not set the mark; for another, it resets the buffer boundaries of the current message if you have changed them (e.g., by editing, see [Rmail Editing](Rmail-Editing)). Similarly, the command `/` (`rmail-end-of-message`) scrolls forward to the end of the selected message.

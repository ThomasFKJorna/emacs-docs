A *table* consists of a rectangular text area which is divided into *cells*. Each cell must be at least one character wide and one character high, not counting its border lines. A cell can be subdivided into more cells, but they cannot overlap.

Cell border lines are drawn with three special characters, specified by the following variables:

### `table-cell-vertical-char`

The character used for vertical lines. The default is ‘`|`’.

### `table-cell-horizontal-chars`

The characters used for horizontal lines. The default is ‘`"-="`’.

### `table-cell-intersection-char`

The character used for the intersection of horizontal and vertical lines. The default is ‘`+`’.

The following are examples of *invalid* tables:

```lisp
   +-----+       +--+    +-++--+
   |     |       |  |    | ||  |
   |     |       |  |    | ||  |
   +--+  |    +--+--+    +-++--+
   |  |  |    |  |  |    +-++--+
   |  |  |    |  |  |    | ||  |
   +--+--+    +--+--+    +-++--+
      a          b          c
```

From left to right:

1.  Overlapped cells or non-rectangular cells are not allowed.
2.  The border must be rectangular.
3.  Cells must have a minimum width/height of one character.

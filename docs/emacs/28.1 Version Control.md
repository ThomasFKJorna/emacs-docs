A *version control system* is a program that can record multiple versions of a source file, storing information such as the creation time of each version, who made it, and a description of what was changed.

The Emacs version control interface is called *VC*. VC commands work with several different version control systems; currently, it supports Bazaar, CVS, Git, Mercurial, Monotone, RCS, SRC, SCCS/CSSC, and Subversion. Of these, the GNU project distributes CVS, RCS, and Bazaar.

VC is enabled automatically whenever you visit a file governed by a version control system. To disable VC entirely, set the customizable variable `vc-handled-backends` to `nil` (see [Customizing VC](/docs/emacs/Customizing-VC)).

To update the VC state information for the file visited in the current buffer, use the command `vc-refresh-state`. This command is useful when you perform version control commands outside Emacs (e.g., from the shell prompt), or if you put the buffer’s file under a different version control system, or remove it from version control entirely.

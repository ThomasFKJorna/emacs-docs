slug: Gnus-Group-Buffer
---

The following commands are available in the Gnus group buffer:

### `SPC`

Switch to the summary buffer for the group on the current line (`gnus-group-read-group`).

### `l`

### `A s`

In the group buffer, list only the groups to which you subscribe and which contain unread articles (`gnus-group-list-groups`; this is the default listing).

### `L`

### `A u`

List all subscribed and unsubscribed groups, but not killed or zombie groups (`gnus-group-list-all-groups`).

### `A k`

List killed groups (`gnus-group-list-killed`).

### `A z`

List zombie groups (`gnus-group-list-zombies`).

### `u`

Toggle the subscription status of the group (`gnus-group-unsubscribe-current-group`) on the current line (i.e., turn a subscribed group into an unsubscribed group, or vice versa). Invoking this on a killed or zombie group turns it into an unsubscribed group.

### `C-k`

Kill the group on the current line (`gnus-group-kill-group`). Killed groups are not recorded in the `.newsrc` file, and they are not shown in the `l` or `L` listings.

### `DEL`

Move point to the previous group containing unread articles (`gnus-group-prev-unread-group`).

### `n`

Move point to the next unread group (`gnus-group-next-unread-group`).

### `p`

Move point to the previous unread group (`gnus-group-prev-unread-group`).

### `q`

Update your Gnus settings, and quit Gnus (`gnus-group-exit`).

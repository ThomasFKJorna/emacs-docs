This chapter describes some simple methods to customize the behavior of Emacs.

Apart from the methods described here, see [X Resources](X-Resources) for information about using X resources to customize Emacs, and see [Keyboard Macros](Keyboard-Macros) for information about recording and replaying keyboard macros. Making more far-reaching and open-ended changes involves writing Emacs Lisp code; see [Emacs Lisp](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/elisp.html#Top) in The Emacs Lisp Reference Manual.

slug: Minibuffer-Maps
---

The minibuffer has its own set of local keymaps; they contain various completion and exit commands.

*   `minibuffer-local-map` is used for ordinary input (no completion).
*   `minibuffer-local-ns-map` is similar, except that `SPC` exits just like `RET`.
*   `minibuffer-local-completion-map` is for permissive completion.
*   `minibuffer-local-must-match-map` is for strict completion and for cautious completion.
*   `minibuffer-local-filename-completion-map` and `minibuffer-local-filename-must-match-map` are like the two previous ones, but they are specifically for file name completion. They do not bind `SPC`.

### `C-h v var RET`

Display the value and documentation of variable `var` (`describe-variable`).

### `M-x set-variable RET var RET value RET`

Change the value of variable `var` to `value`.

To examine the value of a variable, use `C-h v` (`describe-variable`). This reads a variable name using the minibuffer, with completion, and displays both the value and the documentation of the variable. For example,

```lisp
C-h v fill-column RET
```

displays something like this:

```lisp
fill-column is a variable defined in ‘C source code’.
Its value is 70

  Automatically becomes buffer-local when set.
  This variable is safe as a file local variable if its value
  satisfies the predicate ‘integerp’.
  Probably introduced at or before Emacs version 18.

Documentation:
Column beyond which automatic line-wrapping should happen.
Interactively, you can set the buffer local value using C-x f.

You can customize this variable.
```

The line that says ‘`You can customize the variable`’ indicates that this variable is a user option. `C-h v` is not restricted to user options; it allows non-customizable variables too.

The most convenient way to set a specific customizable variable is with `M-x set-variable`. This reads the variable name with the minibuffer (with completion), and then reads a Lisp expression for the new value using the minibuffer a second time (you can insert the old value into the minibuffer for editing via `M-n`). For example,

```lisp
M-x set-variable RET fill-column RET 75 RET
```

sets `fill-column` to 75.

`M-x set-variable` is limited to customizable variables, but you can set any variable with a Lisp expression like this:

```lisp
(setq fill-column 75)
```

To execute such an expression, type `M-:` (`eval-expression`) and enter the expression in the minibuffer (see [Lisp Eval](Lisp-Eval)). Alternatively, go to the `*scratch*` buffer, type in the expression, and then type `C-j` (see [Lisp Interaction](Lisp-Interaction)).

Setting variables, like all means of customizing Emacs except where otherwise stated, affects only the current Emacs session. The only way to alter the variable in future sessions is to put something in your initialization file (see [Init File](Init-File)).

The best way to keep a program properly indented is to use Emacs to reindent it as you change it. Emacs has commands to indent either a single line, a specified number of lines, or all of the lines inside a single parenthetical grouping.

See [Indentation](Indentation), for general information about indentation. This section describes indentation features specific to programming language modes.

Emacs also provides a Lisp pretty-printer in the `pp` package, which reformats Lisp objects with nice-looking indentation. See [pp](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/elisp.html#Output-Functions) in The Emacs Lisp Reference Manual.

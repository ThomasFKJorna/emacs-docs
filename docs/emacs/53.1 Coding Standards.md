Contributed code should follow the GNU Coding Standards [https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/). This may also be available in info on your system.

If it doesn’t, we’ll need to find someone to fix the code before we can use it.

Emacs has additional style and coding conventions:

*   the “Tips and Conventions" Appendix in the Emacs Lisp Reference [https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html\_node/elisp/Tips.html](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Tips.html).
*   Avoid using `defadvice` or `with-eval-after-load` for Lisp code to be included in Emacs.
*   Remove all trailing whitespace in all source and text files.
*   Emacs has no convention on whether to use tabs in source code; please don’t change whitespace in the files you edit.
*   Use `?\s` instead of `? `in Lisp code for a space character.

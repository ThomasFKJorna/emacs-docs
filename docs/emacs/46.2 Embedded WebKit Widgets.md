If Emacs was compiled with the appropriate support packages, it is able to show browser widgets in its buffers. The command `M-x xwidget-webkit-browse-url` asks for a URL to display in the browser widget. The URL normally defaults to the URL at or before point, but if there is an active region (see [Mark](/docs/emacs/Mark)), the default URL comes from the region instead, after removing any whitespace from it. The command then creates a new buffer with the embedded browser showing the specified URL. The buffer is put in the Xwidget-WebKit mode (similar to Image mode, see [Image Mode](/docs/emacs/Image-Mode)), which provides one-key commands for scrolling the widget, changing its size, and reloading it. Type `C-hÂ b`<!-- /@w --> in that buffer to see the key bindings.

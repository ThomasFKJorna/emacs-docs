slug: History-References
---

Various shells, including csh and bash, support *history references* that begin with ‘`!`’ and ‘`^`’. Shell mode recognizes these constructs, and can perform the history substitution for you.

If you insert a history reference and type `TAB`, this searches the input history for a matching command, performs substitution if necessary, and places the result in the buffer in place of the history reference. For example, you can fetch the most recent command beginning with ‘`mv`’ with `! m v TAB`. You can edit the command if you wish, and then resubmit the command to the shell by typing `RET`.

Shell mode can optionally expand history references in the buffer when you send them to the shell. To request this, set the variable `comint-input-autoexpand` to `input`. You can make `SPC` perform history expansion by binding `SPC` to the command `comint-magic-space`. See [Rebinding](Rebinding).

Shell mode recognizes history references when they follow a prompt. See [Shell Prompts](Shell-Prompts), for how Shell mode recognizes prompts.

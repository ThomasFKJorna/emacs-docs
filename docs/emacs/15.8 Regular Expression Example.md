slug: Regexp-Example
---

Here is an example of a regexp—similar to the regexp that Emacs uses, by default, to recognize the end of a sentence, not including the following space (i.e., the variable `sentence-end-base`):

```lisp
[.?!][]\"')}]*
```

This contains two parts in succession: a character set matching period, ‘`?`’, or ‘`!`’, and a character set matching close-brackets, quotes, or parentheses, repeated zero or more times.

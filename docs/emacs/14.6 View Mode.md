slug: View-Mode
---

View mode is a minor mode that lets you scan a buffer by sequential screenfuls. It provides commands for scrolling through the buffer conveniently but not for changing it. Apart from the usual Emacs cursor motion commands, you can type `SPC` to scroll forward one windowful, `S-SPC` or `DEL` to scroll backward, and `s` to start an incremental search.

Typing `q` (`View-quit`) disables View mode, and switches back to the buffer and position before View mode was enabled. Typing `e` (`View-exit`) disables View mode, keeping the current buffer and position.

`M-x view-buffer` prompts for an existing Emacs buffer, switches to it, and enables View mode. `M-x view-file` prompts for a file and visits it with View mode enabled.

The FFAP package replaces certain key bindings for finding files, such as `C-x C-f`, with commands that provide more sensible defaults. These commands behave like the ordinary ones when given a prefix argument. Otherwise, they get the default file name or URL from the text around point. If what is found in the buffer has the form of a URL rather than a file name, the commands use `browse-url` to view it (see [Browse-URL](Browse_002dURL)).

This feature is useful for following references in mail or news buffers, `README` files, `MANIFEST` files, and so on. For more information, view the package commentary by typing `C-h P ffap RET`.

To enable FFAP, type `M-x ffap-bindings`. This makes the following key bindings, and also installs hooks for additional FFAP functionality in Rmail, Gnus and VM article buffers.

### `C-x C-f filename RET`

Find `filename`, guessing a default from text around point (`find-file-at-point`).

### `C-x C-r filename RET`

`ffap-read-only`, analogous to `find-file-read-only`.

### `C-x C-v filename RET`

`ffap-alternate-file`, analogous to `find-alternate-file`.

### `C-x d directory RET`

Start Dired on `directory`, defaulting to the directory at point (`dired-at-point`).

### `C-x C-d directory RET`

`ffap-list-directory`, analogous to `list-directory`.

### `C-x 4 f filename RET`

`ffap-other-window`, analogous to `find-file-other-window`.

### `C-x 4 r filename RET`

`ffap-read-only-other-window`, analogous to `find-file-read-only-other-window`.

### `C-x 4 d directory RET`

`ffap-dired-other-window`, like `dired-other-window`.

### `C-x 5 f filename RET`

`ffap-other-frame`, analogous to `find-file-other-frame`.

### `C-x 5 r filename RET`

`ffap-read-only-other-frame`, analogous to `find-file-read-only-other-frame`.

### `C-x 5 d directory RET`

`ffap-dired-other-frame`, analogous to `dired-other-frame`.

### `M-x ffap-next`

Search buffer for next file name or URL, then find that file or URL.

### `S-mouse-3`

`ffap-at-mouse` finds the file guessed from text around the position of a mouse click.

### `C-S-mouse-3`

Display a menu of files and URLs mentioned in current buffer, then find the one you select (`ffap-menu`).

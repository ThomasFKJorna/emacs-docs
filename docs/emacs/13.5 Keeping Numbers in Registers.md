There are commands to store a number in a register, to insert the number in the buffer in decimal, and to increment it. These commands can be useful in keyboard macros (see [Keyboard Macros](/docs/emacs/Keyboard-Macros)).

### `C-u number C-x r n r`

Store `number` into register `r` (`number-to-register`).

### `C-u number C-x r + r`

If `r` contains a number, increment the number in that register by `number`. Note that command `C-x r +` (`increment-register`) behaves differently if `r` contains text. See [Text Registers](/docs/emacs/Text-Registers).

### `C-x r i r`

Insert the number from register `r` into the buffer.

`C-x r i` is the same command used to insert any other sort of register contents into the buffer. `C-x r +` with no numeric argument increments the register value by 1; `C-x r n` with no numeric argument stores zero in the register.

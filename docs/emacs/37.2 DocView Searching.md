slug: DocView-Searching

In DocView mode, you can search the fileâ€™s text for a regular expression (see [Regexps](Regexps)). The interface for searching is inspired by `isearch` (see [Incremental Search](Incremental-Search)).

To begin a search, type `C-s` (`doc-view-search`) or `C-r` (`doc-view-search-backward`). This reads a regular expression using a minibuffer, then echoes the number of matches found within the document. You can move forward and back among the matches by typing `C-s` and `C-r`. DocView mode has no way to show the match inside the page image; instead, it displays a tooltip (at the mouse position) listing all matching lines in the current page. To force display of this tooltip, type `C-t` (`doc-view-show-tooltip`).

To start a new search, use the search command with a prefix argument; i.e., `C-u C-s` for a forward search or `C-u C-r` for a backward search.

### `C-x v u`

Revert the work file(s) in the current VC fileset to the last revision (`vc-revert`).

If you want to discard all the changes you have made to the current VC fileset, type `C-x v u` (`vc-revert`). This shows you a diff between the work file(s) and the revision from which you started editing, and asks for confirmation for discarding the changes. If you agree, the fileset is reverted. If you donâ€™t want `C-x v u` to show a diff, set the variable `vc-revert-show-diff` to `nil` (you can still view the diff directly with `C-x v =`; see [Old Revisions](Old-Revisions)).

On locking-based version control systems, `C-x v u` leaves files unlocked; you must lock again to resume editing. You can also use `C-x v u` to unlock a file if you lock it and then decide not to change it.

slug: Customization-Groups

Customization settings are organized into *customization groups*. These groups are collected into bigger groups, all the way up to a master group called `Emacs`.

`M-x customize` creates a customization buffer that shows the top-level `Emacs` group. It looks like this, in part:

```lisp
For help using this buffer, see [Easy Customization] in the [Emacs manual].

Emacs group: Customization of the One True Editor.
      [State]: visible group members are all at standard values.
      See also [Manual].

[Editing]      Basic text editing facilities.
[Convenience]  Convenience features for faster editing.

...more second-level groups...
```

The main part of this buffer shows the ‘`Emacs`’ customization group, which contains several other groups (‘`Editing`’, ‘`Convenience`’, etc.). The contents of those groups are not listed here, only one line of documentation each.

The *state* of the group indicates whether setting in that group has been edited, set, or saved. See [Changing a Variable](/docs/emacs/Changing-a-Variable).

Most of the customization buffer is read-only, but it includes some *editable fields* that you can edit. For example, at the top of the customization buffer is an editable field for searching for settings (see [Browsing Custom](/docs/emacs/Browsing-Custom)). There are also *buttons* and *links*, which you can activate by either clicking with the mouse, or moving point there and typing `RET`. For example, the group names like ‘`[Editing]`’ are links; activating one of these links brings up the customization buffer for that group.

In the customization buffer, you can type `TAB` (`widget-forward`) to move forward to the next button or editable field. `S-TAB` (`widget-backward`) moves back to the previous button or editable field.

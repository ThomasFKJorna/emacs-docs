slug: Hungry-Delete
---

If you want to delete an entire block of whitespace at point, you can use *hungry deletion*. This deletes all the contiguous whitespace either before point or after point in a single operation. *Whitespace* here includes tabs and newlines, but not comments or preprocessor commands.

### `C-c C-DEL`

### `C-c DEL`

Delete the entire block of whitespace preceding point (`c-hungry-delete-backwards`).

### `C-c C-d`

### `C-c C-Delete`

### `C-c Delete`

Delete the entire block of whitespace after point (`c-hungry-delete-forward`).

As an alternative to the above commands, you can enable *hungry delete mode*. When this feature is enabled (indicated by ‘`h`’ after a ‘`/`’ in the mode line after the mode name), a single `DEL` deletes all preceding whitespace, not just one space, and a single `C-d` (but *not* plain `Delete`) deletes all following whitespace.

### `M-x c-toggle-hungry-state`

Toggle the hungry-delete feature (`c-toggle-hungry-state`). With a prefix argument, this command turns the hungry-delete feature on if the argument is positive, and off if it is negative.

The variable `c-hungry-delete-key` controls whether the hungry-delete feature is enabled.

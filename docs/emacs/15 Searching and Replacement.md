Like other editors, Emacs has commands to search for occurrences of a string. Emacs also has commands to replace occurrences of a string with a different string. There are also commands that do the same thing, but search for patterns instead of fixed strings.

You can also search multiple files under the control of `xref` (see [Identifier Search](Identifier-Search)) or through the Dired `A` command (see [Operating on Files](Operating-on-Files)), or ask the `grep` program to do it (see [Grep Searching](Grep-Searching)).

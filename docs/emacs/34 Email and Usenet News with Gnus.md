Gnus is an Emacs package primarily designed for reading and posting Usenet news. It can also be used to read and respond to messages from a number of other sources—email, remote directories, digests, and so on. Here we introduce Gnus and describe several basic features. For full details, see [Gnus](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/gnus.html#Top) in The Gnus Manual.

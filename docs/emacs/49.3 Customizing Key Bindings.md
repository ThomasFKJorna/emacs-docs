This section describes *key bindings*, which map keys to commands, and *keymaps*, which record key bindings. It also explains how to customize key bindings, which is done by editing your init file (see [Init Rebinding](Init-Rebinding)).

Since most modes define their own key bindings, activating a mode might override your custom key bindings. A small number of keys are reserved for user-defined bindings, and should not be used by modes, so key bindings using those keys are safer in this regard. The reserved key sequences are those consisting of `C-c` followed by a letter (either upper or lower case), and function keys `F5` through `F9` without modifiers (see [Modifier Keys](Modifier-Keys)).

slug: Subdirectory-Motion
---

When a Dired buffer lists subdirectories, you can use the page motion commands `C-x [` and `C-x ]` to move by entire directories (see [Pages](Pages)).

The following commands move across, up and down in the tree of directories within one Dired buffer. They move to *directory header lines*, which are the lines that give a directory’s name, at the beginning of the directory’s contents.

### `C-M-n`

Go to next subdirectory header line, regardless of level (`dired-next-subdir`).

### `C-M-p`

Go to previous subdirectory header line, regardless of level (`dired-prev-subdir`).

### `C-M-u`

Go up to the parent directory’s header line (`dired-tree-up`).

### `C-M-d`

Go down in the directory tree, to the first subdirectory’s header line (`dired-tree-down`).

### `<`

Move up to the previous directory-file line (`dired-prev-dirline`). These lines are the ones that describe a directory as a file in its parent directory.

### `>`

Move down to the next directory-file line (`dired-next-dirline`).

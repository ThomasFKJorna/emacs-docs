The variable `tab-always-indent` tweaks the behavior of the `TAB` (`indent-for-tab-command`) command. The default value, `t`, gives the behavior described in [Indentation](/docs/emacs/Indentation). If you change the value to the symbol `complete`, then `TAB` first tries to indent the current line, and if the line was already indented, it tries to complete the text at point (see [Symbol Completion](/docs/emacs/Symbol-Completion)). If the value is `nil`, then `TAB` indents the current line only if point is at the left margin or in the lineâ€™s indentation; otherwise, it inserts a tab character.

Electric Indent mode is a global minor mode that automatically indents the line after every `RET` you type. This mode is enabled by default. To toggle this minor mode, type `M-x electric-indent-mode`. To toggle the mode in a single buffer, use `M-x electric-indent-local-mode`.

If your incoming mail is stored on a local machine in a format other than Unix mailbox, you will need the Mailutils `movemail` to retrieve it. See [Movemail](Movemail), for the detailed description of `movemail` versions. For example, to access mail from an inbox in `maildir` format located in `/var/spool/mail/in`, you would include the following in the Rmail inbox list:

```lisp
maildir:///var/spool/mail/in
```

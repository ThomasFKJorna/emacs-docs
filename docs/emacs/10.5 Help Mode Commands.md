slug: Help-Mode

Help buffers provide the same commands as View mode (see [View Mode](/docs/emacs/View-Mode)); for instance, `SPC` scrolls forward, and `DEL` or `S-SPC` scrolls backward. A few special commands are also provided:

### `RET`

Follow a cross reference at point (`help-follow`).

### `TAB`

Move point forward to the next hyperlink (`forward-button`).

### `S-TAB`

Move point back to the previous hyperlink (`backward-button`).

### `mouse-1`

### `mouse-2`

Follow a hyperlink that you click on.

### `C-c C-c`

Show all documentation about the symbol at point (`help-follow-symbol`).

### `C-c C-f`

### `r`

Go forward to the next help topic (`help-go-forward`).

### `C-c C-b`

### `l`

Go back to the previous help topic (`help-go-back`).

When a function name, variable name, or face name (see [Faces](/docs/emacs/Faces)) appears in the documentation in the help buffer, it is normally an underlined *hyperlink*. To view the associated documentation, move point there and type `RET` (`help-follow`), or click on the hyperlink with `mouse-1` or `mouse-2`. Doing so replaces the contents of the help buffer; to retrace your steps, type `C-c C-b` or `l` (`help-go-back`). While retracing your steps, you can go forward by using `C-c C-f` or `r` (`help-go-forward`).

A help buffer can also contain hyperlinks to Info manuals, source code definitions, and URLs (web pages). The first two are opened in Emacs, and the third using a web browser via the `browse-url` command (see [Browse-URL](/docs/emacs/Browse_002dURL)).

In a help buffer, `TAB` (`forward-button`) moves point forward to the next hyperlink, while `S-TAB` (`backward-button`) moves point back to the previous hyperlink. These commands act cyclically; for instance, typing `TAB` at the last hyperlink moves back to the first hyperlink.

To view all documentation about any symbol in the text, move point to the symbol and type `C-c C-c` (`help-follow-symbol`). This shows the documentation for all the meanings of the symbolâ€”as a variable, as a function, and/or as a face.

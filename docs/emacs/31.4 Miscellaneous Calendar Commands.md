### `p d`

Display day-in-year (`calendar-print-day-of-year`).

### `C-c C-l`

Regenerate the calendar window (`calendar-redraw`).

### `SPC`

Scroll the next window up (`scroll-other-window`).

### `DEL`

### `S-SPC`

Scroll the next window down (`scroll-other-window-down`).

### `q`

Exit from calendar (`calendar-exit`).

To display the number of days elapsed since the start of the year, or the number of days remaining in the year, type the `p d` command (`calendar-print-day-of-year`). This displays both of those numbers in the echo area. The count of days elapsed includes the selected date. The count of days remaining does not include that date.

If the calendar window text gets corrupted, type `C-c C-l` (`calendar-redraw`) to redraw it. (This can only happen if you use non-Calendar-mode editing commands.)

In Calendar mode, you can use `SPC` (`scroll-other-window`) and `DEL` (`scroll-other-window-down`) to scroll the other window (if there is one) up or down, respectively. This is handy when you display a list of holidays or diary entries in another window.

To exit from the calendar, type `q` (`calendar-exit`). This buries all buffers related to the calendar, selecting other buffers. (If a frame contains a dedicated calendar window, exiting from the calendar deletes or iconifies that frame depending on the value of `calendar-remove-frame-by-deleting`.)

slug: Dired-Visiting
---

There are several Dired commands for visiting or examining the files listed in the Dired buffer. All of them apply to the current line’s file; if that file is really a directory, these commands invoke Dired on that subdirectory (making a separate Dired buffer).

### `f`

Visit the file described on the current line, like typing `C-x C-f` and supplying that file name (`dired-find-file`). See [Visiting](/docs/emacs/Visiting).

### `RET`

### `e`

Equivalent to `f`.

### `o`

Like `f`, but uses another window to display the file’s buffer (`dired-find-file-other-window`). The Dired buffer remains visible in the first window. This is like using `C-x 4 C-f` to visit the file. See [Windows](/docs/emacs/Windows).

### `C-o`

Visit the file described on the current line, and display the buffer in another window, but do not select that window (`dired-display-file`).

### `mouse-1`

### `mouse-2`

Visit the file whose name you clicked on (`dired-mouse-find-file-other-window`). This uses another window to display the file, like the `o` command.

### `v`

View the file described on the current line, with View mode (`dired-view-file`). View mode provides convenient commands to navigate the buffer but forbids changing it; See [View Mode](/docs/emacs/View-Mode).

### `^`

Visit the parent directory of the current directory (`dired-up-directory`). This is equivalent to moving to the line for `..` and typing `f` there.

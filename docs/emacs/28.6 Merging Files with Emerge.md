It’s not unusual for programmers to get their signals crossed and modify the same program in two different directions. To recover from this confusion, you need to merge the two versions. Emerge makes this easier. For other ways to compare files, see [Comparing Files](/docs/emacs/Comparing-Files), and [Ediff](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/ediff.html#Top) in The Ediff Manual.

A register can contain a rectangle instead of linear text. See [Rectangles](Rectangles), for basic information on how to specify a rectangle in the buffer.

### `C-x r r r`

Copy the region-rectangle into register `r` (`copy-rectangle-to-register`). With prefix argument, delete it as well.

### `C-x r i r`

Insert the rectangle stored in register `r` (if it contains a rectangle) (`insert-register`).

The `C-x r i r` (`insert-register`) command, previously documented in [Text Registers](Text-Registers), inserts a rectangle rather than a text string, if the register contains a rectangle.

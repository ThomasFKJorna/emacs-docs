Emacs has major modes for several variants of Lisp. They use the same editing commands as other programming language modes (see [Programs](/docs/emacs/Programs)). In addition, they provide special commands for executing Lisp expressions.

### Emacs Lisp mode

The mode for editing Emacs Lisp source files. It defines `C-M-x` to evaluate the current top-level Lisp expression. See [Lisp Eval](/docs/emacs/Lisp-Eval).

### Lisp Interaction mode

The mode for an interactive Emacs Lisp session. It defines `C-j` to evaluate the expression before point and insert its value in the buffer. See [Lisp Interaction](/docs/emacs/Lisp-Interaction).

### Lisp mode

The mode for editing source files of programs that run in Lisps other than Emacs Lisp. It defines `C-M-x` to evaluate the current top-level expression in an external Lisp. See [External Lisp](/docs/emacs/External-Lisp).

### Inferior Lisp mode

The mode for an interactive session with an external Lisp which is being run as a subprocess (or *inferior process*) of Emacs. See [External Lisp](/docs/emacs/External-Lisp).

### Scheme mode

Like Lisp mode, but for Scheme programs.

### Inferior Scheme mode

Like Inferior Lisp mode, but for Scheme.

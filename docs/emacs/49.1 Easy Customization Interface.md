Emacs has many *settings* which you can change. Most settings are *customizable variables* (see [Variables](Variables)), which are also called *user options*. There is a huge number of customizable variables, controlling numerous aspects of Emacs behavior; the variables documented in this manual are listed in [Variable Index](Variable-Index). A separate class of settings are the *faces*, which determine the fonts, colors, and other attributes of text (see [Faces](Faces)).

To browse and alter settings (both variables and faces), type `M-x customize`. This creates a *customization buffer*, which lets you navigate through a logically organized list of settings, edit and set their values, and save them permanently.

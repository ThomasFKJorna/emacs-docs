You can save the window configuration of the selected frame in a register, or even the configuration of all windows in all frames, and restore the configuration later. See [Windows](/docs/emacs/Windows), for information about window configurations.

### `C-x r w r`

Save the state of the selected frameâ€™s windows in register `r` (`window-configuration-to-register`).

### `C-x r f r`

Save the state of all frames, including all their windows, in register `r` (`frameset-to-register`).

Use `C-x r j r` to restore a window or frame configuration. This is the same command used to restore a cursor position. When you restore a frame configuration, any existing frames not included in the configuration become invisible. If you wish to delete these frames instead, use `C-u C-x r j r`.

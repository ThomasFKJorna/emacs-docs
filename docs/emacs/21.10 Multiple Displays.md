A single Emacs can talk to more than one X display. Initially, Emacs uses just one display—the one specified with the `DISPLAY` environment variable or with the ‘`--display`’ option (see [Initial Options](Initial-Options)). To connect to another display, use the command `make-frame-on-display`:

### `M-x make-frame-on-display RET display RET`

Create a new frame on display `display`.

A single X server can handle more than one screen. When you open frames on two screens belonging to one server, Emacs knows they share a single keyboard, and it treats all the commands arriving from these screens as a single stream of input.

When you open frames on different X servers, Emacs makes a separate input stream for each server. Each server also has its own selected frame. The commands you enter with a particular X server apply to that server’s selected frame.

On multi-monitor displays it is possible to use the command `make-frame-on-monitor`:

### `M-x make-frame-on-monitor RET monitor RET`

Create a new frame on monitor `monitor` whose screen area is a part of the current display.

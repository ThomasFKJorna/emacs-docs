### `M-x goto-address-mode`

Activate URLs and e-mail addresses in the current buffer.

You can make Emacs mark out URLs specially in the current buffer, by typing `M-x goto-address-mode`. When this buffer-local minor mode is enabled, it finds all the URLs in the buffer, highlights them, and turns them into clickable buttons. You can follow the URL by typing `C-c RET` (`goto-address-at-point`) while point is on its text; or by clicking with `mouse-2`, or by clicking `mouse-1` quickly (see [Mouse References](/docs/emacs/Mouse-References)). Following a URL is done by calling `browse-url` as a subroutine (see [Browse-URL](/docs/emacs/Browse_002dURL)).

It can be useful to add `goto-address-mode` to mode hooks and hooks for displaying an incoming message (e.g., `rmail-show-message-hook` for Rmail). This is not needed for Gnus or MH-E, which have similar features of their own.

The default major mode for the `*mail*` buffer is called Message mode. It behaves like Text mode in many ways, but provides several additional commands on the `C-c` prefix, which make editing a message more convenient.

In this section, we will describe some of the most commonly-used commands available in Message mode. Message mode also has its own manual, where its features are described in greater detail. See [Message](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/message.html#Top) in Message.

If you are typing a comment and wish to continue it to another line, type `M-j` or `C-M-j` (`comment-indent-new-line`). This breaks the current line, and inserts the necessary comment delimiters and indentation to continue the comment.

For languages with closing comment delimiters (e.g., ‘`*/`’ in C), the exact behavior of `M-j` depends on the value of the variable `comment-multi-line`. If the value is `nil`, the command closes the comment on the old line and starts a new comment on the new line. Otherwise, it opens a new line within the current comment delimiters.

When Auto Fill mode is on, going past the fill column while typing a comment also continues the comment, in the same way as an explicit invocation of `M-j`.

To turn existing lines into comment lines, use `M-;` with the region active, or use `M-x comment-region` as described in the preceding section.

You can configure C Mode such that when you type a ‘`/`’ at the start of a line in a multi-line block comment, this closes the comment. Enable the `comment-close-slash` clean-up for this. See [Clean-ups](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/ccmode.html#Clean_002dups) in The CC Mode Manual.

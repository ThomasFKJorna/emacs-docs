slug: Package-Keywords

Most optional features in Emacs are grouped into *packages*. Emacs contains several hundred built-in packages, and more can be installed over the network (see [Packages](Packages)).

To make it easier to find packages related to a topic, most packages are associated with one or more *keywords* based on what they do. Type `C-h p` (`finder-by-keyword`) to bring up a list of package keywords, together with a description of what the keywords mean. To view a list of packages for a given keyword, type `RET` on that line; this displays the list of packages in a Package Menu buffer (see [Package Menu](Package-Menu)).

`C-h P` (`describe-package`) prompts for the name of a package (see [Packages](Packages)), and displays a help buffer describing the attributes of the package and the features that it implements. The buffer lists the keywords that relate to the package in the form of buttons. Click on a button with `mouse-1` or `mouse-2` to see the list of other packages related to that keyword.

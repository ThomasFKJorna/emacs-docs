slug: Authentication
---

Some Emacs packages, which connect to other services, require authentication (see [Passwords](/docs/emacs/Passwords)), e.g., see [Gnus](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/gnus.html#Top) in The Gnus Manual, or [Tramp](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/tramp.html#Top) in The Tramp Manual. Because it might be annoying to provide the same user name and password again and again, Emacs offers to keep this information persistent via the `auth-source` library.

By default, the authentication information is taken from the file `~/.authinfo` or `~/.authinfo.gpg` or `~/.netrc`. These files have a syntax similar to netrc files as known from the `ftp` program, like this:

```lisp
machine mymachine login myloginname password mypassword port myport
```

Similarly, the `auth-source` library supports multiple storage backend, currently either the classic netrc backend, JSON files, the Secret Service API, and pass, the standard unix password manager.

All these alternatives can be customized via the user option `auth-sources`, see [Emacs auth-source](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/auth.html#Help-for-users) in Emacs auth-source.

When a password is entered interactively, which is not found via the configured backend, some of the backends offer to save it persistently. This can be changed by customizing the user option `auth-source-save-behavior`.

These calendar commands display the dates and times of the phases of the moon (new moon, first quarter, full moon, last quarter). This feature is useful for debugging problems that depend on the phase of the moon.

### `M`

Display the dates and times for all the quarters of the moon for the three-month period shown (`calendar-lunar-phases`).

### `M-x lunar-phases`

Display dates and times of the quarters of the moon for three months around todayâ€™s date.

Within the calendar, use the `M` command to display a separate buffer of the phases of the moon for the current three-month range. The dates and times listed are accurate to within a few minutes.

Outside the calendar, use the command `M-x lunar-phases` to display the list of the phases of the moon for the current month and the preceding and succeeding months. For information about a different month, use `C-u M-x lunar-phases`, which prompts for the month and year.

The dates and times given for the phases of the moon are given in local time (corrected for daylight saving, when appropriate). See the discussion in the previous section. See [Sunrise/Sunset](/docs/emacs/Sunrise_002fSunset).

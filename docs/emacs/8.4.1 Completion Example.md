slug: Completion-Example
---

A simple example may help here. `M-x` uses the minibuffer to read the name of a command, so completion works by matching the minibuffer text against the names of existing Emacs commands. Suppose you wish to run the command `auto-fill-mode`. You can do that by typing `M-x auto-fill-mode RET`, but it is easier to use completion.

If you type `M-x a u TAB`, the `TAB` looks for completion alternatives (in this case, command names) that start with ‘`au`’. There are several, including `auto-fill-mode` and `autoconf-mode`, but they all begin with `auto`, so the ‘`au`’ in the minibuffer completes to ‘`auto`’. (More commands may be defined in your Emacs session. For example, if a command called `authorize-me` was defined, Emacs could only complete as far as ‘`aut`’.)

If you type `TAB` again immediately, it cannot determine the next character; it could be ‘`-`’, ‘`a`’, or ‘`c`’. So it does not add any characters; instead, `TAB` displays a list of all possible completions in another window.

Next, type `-f`. The minibuffer now contains ‘`auto-f`’, and the only command name that starts with this is `auto-fill-mode`. If you now type `TAB`, completion fills in the rest of the argument ‘`auto-fill-mode`’ into the minibuffer.

Hence, typing just `a u TAB - f TAB` allows you to enter ‘`auto-fill-mode`’.

Nroff mode, a major mode derived from Text mode, is specialized for editing nroff files (e.g., Unix man pages). Type `M-x nroff-mode` to enter this mode. Entering Nroff mode runs the hook `text-mode-hook`, then `nroff-mode-hook` (see [Hooks](/docs/emacs/Hooks)).

In Nroff mode, nroff command lines are treated as paragraph separators, pages are separated by ‘`.bp`’ commands, and comments start with backslash-doublequote. It also defines these commands:

### `M-n`

Move to the beginning of the next line that isn’t an nroff command (`nroff-forward-text-line`). An argument is a repeat count.

### `M-p`

Like `M-n` but move up (`nroff-backward-text-line`).

### `M-?`

Displays in the echo area the number of text lines (lines that are not nroff commands) in the region (`nroff-count-text-lines`).

Electric Nroff mode is a buffer-local minor mode that can be used with Nroff mode. To toggle this minor mode, type `M-x nroff-electric-mode` (see [Minor Modes](/docs/emacs/Minor-Modes)). When the mode is on, each time you type `RET` to end a line containing an nroff command that opens a kind of grouping, the nroff command to close that grouping is automatically inserted on the following line.

If you use Outline minor mode with Nroff mode (see [Outline Mode](/docs/emacs/Outline-Mode)), heading lines are lines of the form ‘`.H`’ followed by a number (the header level).

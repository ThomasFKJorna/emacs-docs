Lisp mode is the major mode for editing programs written in general-purpose Lisp dialects, such as Common Lisp. Its mode command is `M-x lisp-mode`. Emacs uses Lisp mode automatically for files whose names end in `.l`, `.lsp`, or `.lisp`.

You can run an external Lisp session as a subprocess or *inferior process* of Emacs, and pass expressions to it to be evaluated. To begin an external Lisp session, type `M-x run-lisp`. This runs the program named `lisp`, and sets it up so that both input and output go through an Emacs buffer named `*inferior-lisp*`. To change the name of the Lisp program run by `M-x run-lisp`, change the variable `inferior-lisp-program`.

The major mode for the `*lisp*` buffer is Inferior Lisp mode, which combines the characteristics of Lisp mode and Shell mode (see [Shell Mode](/docs/emacs/Shell-Mode)). To send input to the Lisp session, go to the end of the `*lisp*` buffer and type the input, followed by `RET`. Terminal output from the Lisp session is automatically inserted in the buffer.

When you edit a Lisp program in Lisp mode, you can type `C-M-x` (`lisp-eval-defun`) to send an expression from the Lisp mode buffer to a Lisp session that you had started with `M-x run-lisp`. The expression sent is the top-level Lisp expression at or following point. The resulting value goes as usual into the `*inferior-lisp*` buffer. Note that the effect of `C-M-x` in Lisp mode is thus very similar to its effect in Emacs Lisp mode (see [Lisp Eval](/docs/emacs/Lisp-Eval)), except that the expression is sent to a different Lisp environment instead of being evaluated in Emacs.

The facilities for editing Scheme code, and for sending expressions to a Scheme subprocess, are very similar. Scheme source files are edited in Scheme mode, which can be explicitly enabled with `M-x scheme-mode`. You can initiate a Scheme session by typing `M-x run-scheme` (the buffer for interacting with Scheme is named `*scheme*`), and send expressions to it by typing `C-M-x`.

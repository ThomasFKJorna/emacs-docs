Hideshow mode is a buffer-local minor mode that allows you to selectively display portions of a program, which are referred to as *blocks*. Type `M-x hs-minor-mode` to toggle this minor mode (see [Minor Modes](/docs/emacs/Minor-Modes)).

When you use Hideshow mode to hide a block, the block disappears from the screen, to be replaced by an ellipsis (three periods in a row). Just what constitutes a block depends on the major mode. In C mode and related modes, blocks are delimited by braces, while in Lisp mode they are delimited by parentheses. Multi-line comments also count as blocks.

Hideshow mode provides the following commands:

### `C-c @ C-h`

### `C-c @ C-d`

Hide the current block (`hs-hide-block`).

### `C-c @ C-s`

Show the current block (`hs-show-block`).

### `C-c @ C-c`

### `C-c @ C-e`

Either hide or show the current block (`hs-toggle-hiding`).

### `S-mouse-2`

Toggle hiding for the block you click on (`hs-mouse-toggle-hiding`).

### `C-c @ C-M-h`

### `C-c @ C-t`

Hide all top-level blocks (`hs-hide-all`).

### `C-c @ C-M-s`

### `C-c @ C-a`

Show all blocks in the buffer (`hs-show-all`).

### `C-u n C-c @ C-l`

Hide all blocks `n` levels below this block (`hs-hide-level`).

These variables can be used to customize Hideshow mode:

### `hs-hide-comments-when-hiding-all`

If non-`nil`, `C-c @ C-M-h` (`hs-hide-all`) hides comments too.

### `hs-isearch-open`

This variable specifies the conditions under which incremental search should unhide a hidden block when matching text occurs within the block. Its value should be either `code` (unhide only code blocks), `comment` (unhide only comments), `t` (unhide both code blocks and comments), or `nil` (unhide neither code blocks nor comments). The default value is `code`.

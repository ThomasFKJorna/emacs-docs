You can tag an Org entry as a *TODO* item by typing `C-c C-t` (`org-todo`) anywhere in the entry. This adds the keyword ‘`TODO`’ to the heading line. Typing `C-c C-t` again switches the keyword to ‘`DONE`’; another `C-c C-t` removes the keyword entirely, and so forth. You can customize the keywords used by `C-c C-t` via the variable `org-todo-keywords`.

Apart from marking an entry as TODO, you can attach a date to it, by typing `C-c C-s` (`org-schedule`) in the entry. This prompts for a date by popping up the Emacs Calendar (see [Calendar/Diary](/docs/emacs/Calendar_002fDiary)), and then adds the tag ‘`SCHEDULED`’, together with the selected date, beneath the heading line. The command `C-c C-d` (`org-deadline`) has the same effect, except that it uses the tag `DEADLINE`.

Once you have some TODO items planned in an Org file, you can add that file to the list of *agenda files* by typing `C-c [` (`org-agenda-file-to-front`). Org mode is designed to let you easily maintain multiple agenda files, e.g., for organizing different aspects of your life. The list of agenda files is stored in the variable `org-agenda-files`.

To view items coming from your agenda files, type `M-x org-agenda`. This command prompts for what you want to see: a list of things to do this week, a list of TODO items with specific keywords, etc. See [Agenda Views](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/org.html#Agenda-Views) in The Org Manual, for details.

If you need to execute a keyboard macro (see [Keyboard Macros](/docs/emacs/Keyboard-Macros)) frequently, it is more convenient to put it in a register or save it (see [Save Keyboard Macro](/docs/emacs/Save-Keyboard-Macro)). `C-x C-k x r` (`kmacro-to-register`) stores the last keyboard macro in register `r`.

To execute the keyboard macro in register `r`, type `C-x r j r`. (This is the same command used to jump to a position or restore a frameset.)

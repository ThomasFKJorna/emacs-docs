LaTeX mode provides a few extra features not applicable to plain TeX:

### `C-c C-o`

Insert ‘`\begin`’ and ‘`\end`’ for LaTeX block and position point on a line between them (`tex-latex-block`).

### `C-c C-e`

Close the innermost LaTeX block not yet closed (`tex-close-latex-block`).

In LaTeX input, ‘`\begin`’ and ‘`\end`’ tags are used to group blocks of text. To insert a block, type `C-c C-o` (`tex-latex-block`). This prompts for a block type, and inserts the appropriate matching ‘`\begin`’ and ‘`\end`’ tags, leaving a blank line between the two and moving point there.

When entering the block type argument to `C-c C-o`, you can use the usual completion commands (see [Completion](Completion)). The default completion list contains the standard LaTeX block types. If you want additional block types for completion, customize the list variable `latex-block-names`.

In LaTeX input, ‘`\begin`’ and ‘`\end`’ tags must balance. You can use `C-c C-e` (`tex-close-latex-block`) to insert an ‘`\end`’ tag which matches the last unmatched ‘`\begin`’. It also indents the ‘`\end`’ to match the corresponding ‘`\begin`’, and inserts a newline after the ‘`\end`’ tag if point is at the beginning of a line. The minor mode `latex-electric-env-pair-mode` automatically inserts an ‘`\end`’ or ‘`\begin`’ tag for you when you type the corresponding one.

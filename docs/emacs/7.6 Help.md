If you forget what a key does, you can find out by typing `C-h k` (`describe-key`), followed by the key of interest; for example, `C-h k C-n` tells you what `C-n` does.

The prefix key `C-h` stands for â€œhelp". The key `F1` serves as an alias for `C-h`. Apart from `C-h k`, there are many other help commands providing different kinds of help.

See [Help](/docs/emacs/Help), for details.

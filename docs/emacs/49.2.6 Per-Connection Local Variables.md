slug: Connection-Variables

Most of the variables reflect the situation on the local machine. Often, they must use a different value when you operate in buffers with a remote default directory. Think about the shell to be applied when calling `shell` â€“ it might be `/bin/bash` on your local machine, and `/bin/ksh` on a remote machine.

This can be accomplished with *connection-local variables*. Directory and file local variables override connection-local variables. Unsafe connection-local variables are handled in the same way as unsafe file-local variables (see [Safe File Variables](Safe-File-Variables)).

Connection-local variables are declared as a group of variables/value pairs in a *profile*, using the `connection-local-set-profile-variables` function. The function `connection-local-set-profiles` activates profiles for a given criteria, identifying a remote machine:

```lisp
(connection-local-set-profile-variables 'remote-ksh
   '((shell-file-name . "/bin/ksh")
     (shell-command-switch . "-c")))

(connection-local-set-profile-variables 'remote-bash
   '((shell-file-name . "/bin/bash")
     (shell-command-switch . "-c")))

(connection-local-set-profiles
   '(:application tramp :machine "remotemachine") 'remote-ksh)
```

This code declares two different profiles, `remote-ksh` and `remote-bash`. The profile `remote-ksh` is applied to all buffers which have a remote default directory matching the regexp `"remotemachine` as host name. Such a criteria can also discriminate for the properties `:protocol` (this is the Tramp method) or `:user` (a remote user name). The `nil` criteria matches all buffers with a remote default directory.

Fortran mode provides many built-in abbrevs for common keywords and declarations. These are the same sort of abbrev that you can define yourself. To use them, you must turn on Abbrev mode. See [Abbrevs](Abbrevs).

The built-in abbrevs are unusual in one way: they all start with a semicolon. For example, one built-in Fortran abbrev is ‘`;c`’ for ‘`continue`’. If you insert ‘`;c`’ and then insert a punctuation character such as a space or a newline, the ‘`;c`’ expands automatically to ‘`continue`’, provided Abbrev mode is enabled.

Type ‘`;?`’ or ‘`;C-h`’ to display a list of all the built-in Fortran abbrevs and what they stand for.

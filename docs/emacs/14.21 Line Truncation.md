slug: Line-Truncation
---

As an alternative to continuation (see [Continuation Lines](Continuation-Lines)), Emacs can display long lines by *truncation*. This means that all the characters that do not fit in the width of the screen or window do not appear at all. On graphical displays, a small straight arrow in the fringe indicates truncation at either end of the line. On text terminals, this is indicated with ‘`$`’ signs in the rightmost and/or leftmost columns.

Horizontal scrolling automatically causes line truncation (see [Horizontal Scrolling](Horizontal-Scrolling)). You can explicitly enable line truncation for a particular buffer with the command `M-x toggle-truncate-lines`. This works by locally changing the variable `truncate-lines`. If that variable is non-`nil`, long lines are truncated; if it is `nil`, they are continued onto multiple screen lines. Setting the variable `truncate-lines` in any way makes it local to the current buffer; until that time, the default value, which is normally `nil`, is in effect.

If a split window becomes too narrow, Emacs may automatically enable line truncation. See [Split Window](Split-Window), for the variable `truncate-partial-width-windows` which controls this.

On a text terminal, Emacs can display only one Emacs frame at a time. However, you can still create multiple Emacs frames, and switch between them. Switching frames on these terminals is much like switching between different window configurations.

Use `C-x 5 2` to create a new frame and switch to it; use `C-x 5 o` to cycle through the existing frames; use `C-x 5 0` to delete the current frame.

Each frame has a number to distinguish it. If your terminal can display only one frame at a time, the selected frame’s number `n` appears near the beginning of the mode line, in the form ‘`Fn`’.

‘`Fn`’ is in fact the frame’s initial name. You can give frames more meaningful names if you wish, and you can select a frame by its name. Use the command `M-x set-frame-name RET name RET` to specify a new name for the selected frame, and use `M-x select-frame-by-name RET name RET` to select a frame according to its name. The name you specify appears in the mode line when the frame is selected.

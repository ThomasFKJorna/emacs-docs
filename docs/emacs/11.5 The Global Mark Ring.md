slug: Global-Mark-Ring
---

In addition to the ordinary mark ring that belongs to each buffer, Emacs has a single *global mark ring*. Each time you set a mark, this is recorded in the global mark ring in addition to the current bufferâ€™s own mark ring, if you have switched buffers since the previous mark setting. Hence, the global mark ring records a sequence of buffers that you have been in, and, for each buffer, a place where you set the mark. The length of the global mark ring is controlled by `global-mark-ring-max`, and is 16 by default.

The command `C-x C-SPC` (`pop-global-mark`) jumps to the buffer and position of the latest entry in the global ring. It also rotates the ring, so that successive uses of `C-x C-SPC` take you to earlier buffers and mark positions.

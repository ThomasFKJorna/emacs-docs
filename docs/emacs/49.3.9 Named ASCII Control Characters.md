`TAB`, `RET`, `BS`, `LFD`, `ESC`, and `DEL` started out as names for certain ASCII control characters, used so often that they have special keys of their own. For instance, `TAB` was another name for `C-i`. Later, users found it convenient to distinguish in Emacs between these keys and the corresponding control characters typed with the `Ctrl` key. Therefore, on most modern terminals, they are no longer the same: `TAB` is different from `C-i`.

Emacs can distinguish these two kinds of input if the keyboard does. It treats the special keys as function keys named `tab`, `return`, `backspace`, `linefeed`, `escape`, and `delete`. These function keys translate automatically into the corresponding ASCII characters *if* they have no bindings of their own. As a result, neither users nor Lisp programs need to pay attention to the distinction unless they care to.

If you do not want to distinguish between (for example) `TAB` and `C-i`, make just one binding, for the ASCII character `TAB` (octal code 011). If you do want to distinguish, make one binding for this ASCII character, and another for the function key `tab`.

With an ordinary ASCII terminal, there is no way to distinguish between `TAB` and `C-i` (and likewise for other such pairs), because the terminal sends the same character in both cases.

You can transfer diary entries between Emacs diary files and a variety of other formats.

You can import diary entries from Outlook-generated appointment messages. While viewing such a message in Rmail or Gnus, do `M-x diary-from-outlook` to import the entry. You can make this command recognize additional appointment message formats by customizing the variable `diary-outlook-formats`. Other mail clients can set `diary-from-outlook-function` to an appropriate value.

The icalendar package allows you to transfer data between your Emacs diary file and iCalendar files, which are defined in RFC 2445â€”Internet Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object Specification (iCalendar) (as well as the earlier vCalendar format).

The command `icalendar-import-buffer` extracts iCalendar data from the current buffer and adds it to your diary file. This function is also suitable for automatic extraction of iCalendar data; for example with the Rmail mail client one could use:

```lisp
(add-hook 'rmail-show-message-hook 'icalendar-import-buffer)
```

The command `icalendar-import-file` imports an iCalendar file and adds the results to an Emacs diary file. For example:

```lisp
(icalendar-import-file "/here/is/calendar.ics"
                       "/there/goes/ical-diary")
```

You can use an `#include` directive to add the import file contents to the main diary file, if these are different files. See [Fancy Diary Display](/docs/emacs/Fancy-Diary-Display).

Use `icalendar-export-file` to interactively export an entire Emacs diary file to iCalendar format. To export only a part of a diary file, mark the relevant area, and call `icalendar-export-region`. In both cases, Emacs appends the result to the target file.

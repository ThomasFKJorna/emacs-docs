If you visit certain file names frequently, you can visit them more conveniently if you put their names in registers. Here’s the Lisp code used to put a file `name` into register `r`:

```lisp
(set-register r '(file . name))
```

For example,

```lisp
(set-register ?z '(file . "/gd/gnu/emacs/19.0/src/ChangeLog"))
```

puts the file name shown in register ‘`z`’.

To visit the file whose name is in register `r`, type `C-x r j r`. (This is the same command used to jump to a position or restore a frame configuration.)

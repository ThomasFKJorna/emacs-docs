The `table` package provides commands to easily edit text-based tables. Here is an example of what such a table looks like:

```lisp
+-----------------+--------------------------------+-----------------+
|     Command     |          Description           |   Key Binding   |
+-----------------+--------------------------------+-----------------+
|  forward-char   |Move point right N characters   |       C-f       |
|                 |(left if N is negative).        |                 |
|                 |                                |                 |
+-----------------+--------------------------------+-----------------+
|  backward-char  |Move point left N characters    |       C-b       |
|                 |(right if N is negative).       |                 |
|                 |                                |                 |
+-----------------+--------------------------------+-----------------+
```

When Emacs recognizes such a stretch of text as a table (see [Table Recognition](Table-Recognition)), editing the contents of each table cell will automatically resize the table, whenever the contents become too large to fit in the cell. You can use the commands defined in the following sections for navigating and editing the table layout.

Type `M-x table-fixed-width-mode` to toggle the automatic table resizing feature.

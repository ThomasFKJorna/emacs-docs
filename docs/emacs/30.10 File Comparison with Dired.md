The `=` (`dired-diff`) command compares the current file (the file at point) with another file (read using the minibuffer) using the `diff` program. The file specified with the minibuffer is the first argument of `diff`, and file at point is the second argument. The output of the `diff` program is shown in a buffer using Diff mode (see [Comparing Files](Comparing-Files)).

If the region is active, the default for the file read using the minibuffer is the file at the mark (i.e., the ordinary Emacs mark, not a Dired mark; see [Setting Mark](Setting-Mark)). Otherwise, if the file at point has a backup file (see [Backup](Backup)), that is the default.

You could also compare files using `ediff-files`, see [Major Entry Points](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/ediff.html#Major-Entry-Points) in Ediff Userâ€™s Manual.

slug: Kill-Options
---

Some specialized buffers contain *read-only text*, which cannot be modified and therefore cannot be killed. The kill commands work specially in a read-only buffer: they move over text and copy it to the kill ring, without actually deleting it from the buffer. Normally, they also beep and display an error message when this happens. But if you set the variable `kill-read-only-ok` to a non-`nil` value, they just print a message in the echo area to explain why the text has not been erased.

If you change the variable `kill-do-not-save-duplicates` to a non-`nil` value, identical subsequent kills yield a single kill-ring entry, without duplication.

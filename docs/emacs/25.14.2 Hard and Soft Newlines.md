slug: Hard-and-Soft-Newlines
---

In Enriched mode, Emacs distinguishes between two different kinds of newlines, *hard* newlines and *soft* newlines. You can also enable or disable this feature in other buffers, by typing `M-x use-hard-newlines`.

Hard newlines are used to separate paragraphs, or anywhere there needs to be a line break regardless of how the text is filled; soft newlines are used for filling. The `RET` (`newline`) and `C-o` (`open-line`) commands insert hard newlines. The fill commands, including Auto Fill (see [Auto Fill](Auto-Fill)), insert only soft newlines and delete only soft newlines, leaving hard newlines alone.

Thus, when editing with Enriched mode, you should not use `RET` or `C-o` to break lines in the middle of filled paragraphs. Use Auto Fill mode or explicit fill commands (see [Fill Commands](Fill-Commands)) instead. Use `RET` or `C-o` where line breaks should always remain, such as in tables and lists. For such lines, you may also want to set the justification style to `unfilled` (see [Enriched Justification](Enriched-Justification)).

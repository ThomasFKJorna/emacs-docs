slug: Lisp-Indent

The indentation pattern for a Lisp expression can depend on the function called by the expression. For each Lisp function, you can choose among several predefined patterns of indentation, or define an arbitrary one with a Lisp program.

The standard pattern of indentation is as follows: the second line of the expression is indented under the first argument, if that is on the same line as the beginning of the expression; otherwise, the second line is indented underneath the function name. Each following line is indented under the previous line whose nesting depth is the same.

If the variable `lisp-indent-offset` is non-`nil`, it overrides the usual indentation pattern for the second line of an expression, so that such lines are always indented `lisp-indent-offset` more columns than the containing list.

Certain functions override the standard pattern. Functions whose names start with `def` treat the second lines as the start of a *body*, by indenting the second line `lisp-body-indent` additional columns beyond the open-parenthesis that starts the expression.

You can override the standard pattern in various ways for individual functions, according to the `lisp-indent-function` property of the function name. This is normally done for macro definitions, using the `declare` construct. See [Defining Macros](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/elisp.html#Defining-Macros) in The Emacs Lisp Reference Manual.

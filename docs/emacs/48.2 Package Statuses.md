slug: Package-Statuses

A package can have one of the following statuses:

### ‘`available`’

The package is not installed, but can be downloaded and installed from the package archive.

### ‘`avail-obso`’

The package is available for installation, but a newer version is also available. Packages with this status are hidden by default.

### ‘`built-in`’

The package is included in Emacs by default. It cannot be deleted through the package menu, and is not considered for upgrading.

### ‘`dependency`’

The package was installed automatically to satisfy a dependency of another package.

### ‘`disabled`’

The package has been disabled using the `package-load-list` variable.

### ‘`external`’

The package is not built-in and not from the directory specified by `package-user-dir` (see [Package Files](Package-Files)). External packages are treated much like ‘`built-in`’ packages and cannot be deleted.

### ‘`held`’

The package is held, See [Package Installation](Package-Installation).

### ‘`incompat`’

The package cannot be installed for some reason, for example because it depends on uninstallable packages.

### ‘`installed`’

The package is installed.

### ‘`new`’

Equivalent to ‘`available`’, except that the package became newly available on the package archive after your last invocation of `M-x list-packages`.

### ‘`obsolete`’

The package is an outdated installed version; in addition to this version of the package, a newer version is also installed.

The calendar and diary by default display times of day in the conventional American style with the hours from 1 through 12, minutes, and either ‘`am`’ or ‘`pm`’. If you prefer the European style, also known in the US as military, in which the hours go from 00 to 23, you can alter the variable `calendar-time-display-form`. This variable is a list of expressions that can involve the variables `12-hours`, `24-hours`, and `minutes`, which are all numbers in string form, and `am-pm` and `time-zone`, which are both alphabetic strings. The default value is:

```lisp
(12-hours ":" minutes am-pm
          (if time-zone " (") time-zone (if time-zone ")"))
```

Here is a value that provides European style times:

```lisp
(24-hours ":" minutes
          (if time-zone " (") time-zone (if time-zone ")"))
```

Note that few calendar functions return a time of day (at present, only solar functions).

### `M-- M-l`

Convert last word to lower case. Note `Meta--` is Meta-minus.

### `M-- M-u`

Convert last word to all upper case.

### `M-- M-c`

Convert last word to lower case with capital initial.

A very common error is to type words in the wrong case. Because of this, the word case-conversion commands `M-l`, `M-u`, and `M-c` have a special feature when used with a negative argument: they do not move the cursor. As soon as you see you have mistyped the last word, you can simply case-convert it and go on typing. See [Case](Case).

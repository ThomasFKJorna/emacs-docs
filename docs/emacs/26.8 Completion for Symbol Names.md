slug: Symbol-Completion

Completion is normally done in the minibuffer (see [Completion](/docs/emacs/Completion)), but you can also complete symbol names in ordinary Emacs buffers.

In programming language modes, type `C-M-i` or `M-TAB` to complete the partial symbol before point. On graphical displays, the `M-TAB` key is usually reserved by the window manager for switching graphical windows, so you should type `C-M-i` or `ESC TAB` instead.

In most programming language modes, `C-M-i` (or `M-TAB`) invokes the command `completion-at-point`, which generates its completion list in a flexible way. If Semantic mode is enabled, it tries to use the Semantic parser data for completion (see [Semantic](/docs/emacs/Semantic)). If Semantic mode is not enabled or fails at performing completion, it tries to complete using the selected tags table (see [Tags Tables](/docs/emacs/Tags-Tables)). If in Emacs Lisp mode, it performs completion using the function, variable, or property names defined in the current Emacs session.

In all other respects, in-buffer symbol completion behaves like minibuffer completion. For instance, if Emacs cannot complete to a unique symbol, it displays a list of completion alternatives in another window. See [Completion](/docs/emacs/Completion).

In Text mode and related modes, `M-TAB` completes words based on the spell-checkerâ€™s dictionary. See [Spelling](/docs/emacs/Spelling).

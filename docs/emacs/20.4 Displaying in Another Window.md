`C-x 4` is a prefix key for a variety of commands that switch to a buffer in a different windowâ€”either another existing window, or a new window created by splitting the selected window. See [Window Choice](Window-Choice), for how Emacs picks or creates the window to use.

### `C-x 4 b bufname RET`

Select buffer `bufname` in another window (`switch-to-buffer-other-window`). See [Select Buffer](Select-Buffer).

### `C-x 4 C-o bufname RET`

Display buffer `bufname` in some window, without trying to select it (`display-buffer`). See [Displaying Buffers](Displaying-Buffers), for details about how the window is chosen.

### `C-x 4 f filename RET`

Visit file `filename` and select its buffer in another window (`find-file-other-window`). See [Visiting](Visiting).

### `C-x 4 d directory RET`

Select a Dired buffer for directory `directory` in another window (`dired-other-window`). See [Dired](Dired).

### `C-x 4 m`

Start composing a mail message, similar to `C-x m` (see [Sending Mail](Sending-Mail)), but in another window (`compose-mail-other-window`).

### `C-x 4 .`

Find the definition of an identifier, similar to `M-.` (see [Xref](Xref)), but in another window (`xref-find-definitions-other-window`).

### `C-x 4 r filename RET`

Visit file `filename` read-only, and select its buffer in another window (`find-file-read-only-other-window`). See [Visiting](Visiting).

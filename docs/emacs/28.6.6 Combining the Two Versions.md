slug: Combining-in-Emerge

Sometimes you want to keep *both* alternatives for a particular difference. To do this, use `x c`, which edits the merge buffer like this:

```lisp
#ifdef NEW
version from B buffer
#else /* not NEW */
version from A buffer
#endif /* not NEW */
```

While this example shows C preprocessor conditionals delimiting the two alternative versions, you can specify the strings to use by setting the variable `emerge-combine-versions-template` to a string of your choice. In the string, ‘`%a`’ says where to put version A, and ‘`%b`’ says where to put version B. The default setting, which produces the results shown above, looks like this:

```lisp
"#ifdef NEW\n%b#else /* not NEW */\n%a#endif /* not NEW */\n"
```

slug: DocView-Conversion

For efficiency, DocView caches the images produced by `gs`. The name of the directory where it caches images is given by the variable `doc-view-cache-directory`. You can clear the cache directory by typing `M-x doc-view-clear-cache`.

To force reconversion of the currently viewed document, type `r` or `g` (`revert-buffer`). To kill the converter process associated with the current buffer, type `K` (`doc-view-kill-proc`). The command `k` (`doc-view-kill-proc-and-buffer`) kills the converter process and the DocView buffer.

### `C-c C-y`

Yank the selected message from the mail reader, as a citation (`message-yank-original`).

### `C-c C-q`

Fill each paragraph cited from another message (`message-fill-yanked-message`).

You can use the command `C-c C-y` (`message-yank-original`) to *cite* a message that you are replying to. This inserts the text of that message into the mail buffer. This command works only if the mail buffer is invoked from a mail reader running in Emacs, such as Rmail.

By default, Emacs inserts the string ‘`>`’ in front of each line of the cited text; this prefix string is specified by the variable `message-yank-prefix`. If you call `message-yank-original` with a prefix argument, the citation prefix is not inserted.

After using `C-c C-y`, you can type `C-c C-q` (`message-fill-yanked-message`) to fill the paragraphs of the cited message. One use of `C-c C-q` fills all such paragraphs, each one individually. To fill a single paragraph of the quoted message, use `M-q`. If filling does not automatically handle the type of citation prefix you use, try setting the fill prefix explicitly. See [Filling](/docs/emacs/Filling).

You can customize mail citation through the hook `mail-citation-hook`. For example, you can use the Supercite package, which provides more flexible citation (see [Introduction](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/sc.html#Introduction) in Supercite).

slug: Yes-or-No-Prompts
---

An Emacs command may require you to answer a yes-or-no question during the course of its execution. Such queries come in two main varieties.

For the first type of yes-or-no query, the prompt ends with ‘`(y or n)`’<!-- /@w -->. You answer the query by typing a single key, either ‘`y`’ or ‘`n`’, which immediately exits the minibuffer and delivers the response. For example, if you type `C-x C-w` (`write-file`) to save a buffer, and enter the name of an existing file, Emacs issues a prompt like this:

```lisp
File ‘foo.el’ exists; overwrite? (y or n)
```

The second type of yes-or-no query is typically employed if giving the wrong answer would have serious consequences; it thus features a longer prompt ending with ‘`(yes or no)`’. For example, if you invoke `C-x k` (`kill-buffer`) on a file-visiting buffer with unsaved changes, Emacs activates the minibuffer with a prompt like this:

```lisp
Buffer foo.el modified; kill anyway? (yes or no)
```

To answer, you must type ‘`yes`’ or ‘`no`’ into the minibuffer, followed by `RET`.

With both types of yes-or-no query the minibuffer behaves as described in the previous sections; you can recenter the selected window with `C-l`, scroll that window (`C-v` or `PageDown` scrolls forward, `M-v` or `PageUp` scrolls backward), switch to another window with `C-x o`, use the history commands `M-p` and `M-n`, etc. Type `C-g` to dismiss the query, and quit the minibuffer and the querying command (see [Quitting](Quitting)).

Fortran mode has specialized support for Auto Fill mode, which is a minor mode that automatically splits statements as you insert them when they become too wide. Splitting a statement involves making continuation lines using `fortran-continuation-string` (see [ForIndent Cont](/docs/emacs/ForIndent-Cont)). This splitting happens when you type `SPC`, `RET`, or `TAB`, and also in the Fortran indentation commands. You activate Auto Fill in Fortran mode in the normal way. See [Auto Fill](/docs/emacs/Auto-Fill).

Auto Fill breaks lines at spaces or delimiters when the lines get longer than the desired width (the value of `fill-column`). The delimiters (besides whitespace) that Auto Fill can break at are ‘`+`’, ‘`-`’, ‘`/`’, ‘`*`’, ‘`=`’, ‘`<`’, ‘`>`’, and ‘`,`’. The line break comes after the delimiter if the variable `fortran-break-before-delimiters` is `nil`. Otherwise (and by default), the break comes before the delimiter.

To enable Auto Fill in all Fortran buffers, add `auto-fill-mode` to `fortran-mode-hook`. See [Hooks](/docs/emacs/Hooks).

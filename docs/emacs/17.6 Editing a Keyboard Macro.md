### `C-x C-k C-e`

Edit the last defined keyboard macro (`kmacro-edit-macro`).

### `C-x C-k e name RET`

Edit a previously defined keyboard macro `name` (`edit-kbd-macro`).

### `C-x C-k l`

Edit the last 300 keystrokes as a keyboard macro (`kmacro-edit-lossage`).

You can edit the last keyboard macro by typing `C-x C-k C-e` or `C-x C-k RET` (`kmacro-edit-macro`). This formats the macro definition in a buffer and enters a specialized major mode for editing it. Type `C-h m` once in that buffer to display details of how to edit the macro. When you are finished editing, type `C-c C-c`.

You can edit a named keyboard macro or a macro bound to a key by typing `C-x C-k e` (`edit-kbd-macro`). Follow that with the keyboard input that you would use to invoke the macroâ€”`C-x e` or `M-x name` or some other key sequence.

You can edit the last 300 keystrokes as a macro by typing `C-x C-k l` (`kmacro-edit-lossage`).

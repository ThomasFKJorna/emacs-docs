Message mode provides the following special commands to move to particular header fields and to complete addresses in headers.

### `C-c C-f C-t`

Move to the ‘`To`’ header (`message-goto-to`).

### `C-c C-f C-s`

Move to the ‘`Subject`’ header (`message-goto-subject`).

### `C-c C-f C-c`

Move to the ‘`CC`’ header (`message-goto-cc`).

### `C-c C-f C-b`

Move to the ‘`BCC`’ header (`message-goto-bcc`).

### `C-c C-f C-r`

Move to the ‘`Reply-To`’ header (`message-goto-reply-to`).

### `C-c C-f C-f`

Move to the ‘`Mail-Followup-To`’ header field (`message-goto-followup-to`).

### `C-c C-f C-w`

Add a new ‘`FCC`’ header field, with file-name completion (`message-goto-fcc`).

### `C-c C-b`

Move to the start of the message body (`message-goto-body`).

### `TAB`

Complete a mailing address (`message-tab`).

The commands to move point to particular header fields are all based on the prefix `C-c C-f` (‘`C-f`’ is for “field"). If the field in question does not exist, the command creates one (the exception is `mail-fcc`, which creates a new field each time).

The command `C-c C-b` (`message-goto-body`) moves point to just after the header separator line—that is, to the beginning of the body.

While editing a header field that contains addresses, such as ‘`To:`’, ‘`CC:`’ and ‘`BCC:`’, you can complete an address by typing `TAB` (`message-tab`). This attempts to insert the full name corresponding to the address based on a couple of methods, including EUDC, a library that recognizes a number of directory server protocols (see [EUDC](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/eudc.html#Top) in The Emacs Unified Directory Client). Failing that, it attempts to expand the address as a mail alias (see [Mail Aliases](Mail-Aliases)). If point is on a header field that does not take addresses, or if it is in the message body, then `TAB` just inserts a tab character.

### `M-x replace-string RET string RET newstring RET`

Replace every occurrence of `string` with `newstring`.

To replace every instance of ‘`foo`’ after point with ‘`bar`’, use the command `M-x replace-string` with the two arguments ‘`foo`’ and ‘`bar`’. Replacement happens only in the text after point, so if you want to cover the whole buffer you must go to the beginning first. All occurrences up to the end of the buffer are replaced; to limit replacement to part of the buffer, activate the region around that part. When the region is active, replacement is limited to the region (see [Mark](/docs/emacs/Mark)).

When `replace-string` exits, it leaves point at the last occurrence replaced. It adds the prior position of point (where the `replace-string` command was issued) to the mark ring, without activating the mark; use `C-u C-SPC` to move back there. See [Mark Ring](/docs/emacs/Mark-Ring).

A prefix argument restricts replacement to matches that are surrounded by word boundaries.

See [Replacement and Lax Matches](/docs/emacs/Replacement-and-Lax-Matches), for details about case-sensitivity and character folding in replace commands.

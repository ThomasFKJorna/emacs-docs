slug: Replace
---

Emacs provides several commands for performing search-and-replace operations. In addition to the simple `M-x replace-string` command, there is `M-%` (`query-replace`), which presents each occurrence of the search pattern and asks you whether to replace it.

The replace commands normally operate on the text from point to the end of the buffer. When the region is active, they operate on it instead (see [Mark](/docs/emacs/Mark)). The basic replace commands replace one *search string* (or regexp) with one *replacement string*. It is possible to perform several replacements in parallel, using the command `expand-region-abbrevs` (see [Expanding Abbrevs](/docs/emacs/Expanding-Abbrevs)).

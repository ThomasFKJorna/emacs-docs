slug: Title-X

Each Emacs frame always has a title, which appears in window decorations and icons as the name of the frame. The default title is of the form ‘`invocation-name@machine`’ (if there is only one frame) or shows the selected window’s buffer name (if there is more than one frame).

You can specify a non-default title for the initial Emacs frame with a command line option:

### ‘`-T title`’

### ‘`--title=title`’

Specify `title` as the title for the initial Emacs frame.

The ‘`--name`’ option (see [Resources](/docs/emacs/Resources)) also specifies the title for the initial Emacs frame.

In DocView mode, you can scroll the current page using the usual Emacs movement keys: `C-p`, `C-n`, `C-b`, `C-f`, and the arrow keys.

By default, the line-motion keys `C-p` and `C-n` stop scrolling at the beginning and end of the current page, respectively. However, if you change the variable `doc-view-continuous` to a non-`nil` value, then `C-p` displays the previous page if you are already at the beginning of the current page, and `C-n` displays the next page if you are at the end of the current page.

You can also display the next page by typing `n`, `PageDown`, `next` or `C-x ]` (`doc-view-next-page`). To display the previous page, type `p`, `PageUp`, `prior` or `C-x [` (`doc-view-previous-page`).

`SPC` (`doc-view-scroll-up-or-next-page`) is a convenient way to advance through the document. It scrolls within the current page or advances to the next. `DEL` moves backwards in a similar way (`doc-view-scroll-down-or-previous-page`).

To go to the first page, type `M-<` (`doc-view-first-page`); to go to the last one, type `M->` (`doc-view-last-page`). To jump to a page by its number, type `M-g M-g` or `M-g g` (`doc-view-goto-page`).

You can enlarge or shrink the document with `+` (`doc-view-enlarge`) and `-` (`doc-view-shrink`). By default, these commands just rescale the already-rendered image. If you instead want the image to be re-rendered at the new size, set `doc-view-scale-internally` to `nil`. To specify the default size for DocView, customize the variable `doc-view-resolution`.

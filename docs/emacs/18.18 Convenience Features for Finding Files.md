In this section, we introduce some convenient facilities for finding recently-opened files, reading file names from a buffer.

If you enable Recentf mode, with `M-x recentf-mode`, the ‘`File`’ menu includes a submenu containing a list of recently opened files. `M-x recentf-save-list` saves the current `recentf-list` to a file, and `M-x recentf-edit-list` edits it.

The `M-x ffap` command generalizes `find-file` with more powerful heuristic defaults (see [FFAP](FFAP)), often based on the text at point. Partial Completion mode offers other features extending `find-file`, which can be used with `ffap`. See [Completion Options](Completion-Options).

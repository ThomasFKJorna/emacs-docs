### `C-w`

Kill the region (`kill-region`).

### `M-w`

Copy the region into the kill ring (`kill-ring-save`).

### `M-d`

Kill the next word (`kill-word`). See [Words](Words).

### `M-DEL`

Kill one word backwards (`backward-kill-word`).

### `C-x DEL`

Kill back to beginning of sentence (`backward-kill-sentence`). See [Sentences](Sentences).

### `M-k`

Kill to the end of the sentence (`kill-sentence`).

### `C-M-k`

Kill the following balanced expression (`kill-sexp`). See [Expressions](Expressions).

### `M-z char`

Kill through the next occurrence of `char` (`zap-to-char`).

### `M-x zap-up-to-char char`

Kill up to, but not including, the next occurrence of `char`.

One of the commonly-used kill commands is `C-w` (`kill-region`), which kills the text in the region (see [Mark](Mark)). Similarly, `M-w` (`kill-ring-save`) copies the text in the region into the kill ring without removing it from the buffer. If the mark is inactive when you type `C-w` or `M-w`, the command acts on the text between point and where you last set the mark (see [Using Region](Using-Region)).

Emacs also provides commands to kill specific syntactic units: words, with `M-DEL` and `M-d` (see [Words](Words)); balanced expressions, with `C-M-k` (see [Expressions](Expressions)); and sentences, with `C-x DEL` and `M-k` (see [Sentences](Sentences)).

The command `M-z` (`zap-to-char`) combines killing with searching: it reads a character and kills from point up to (and including) the next occurrence of that character in the buffer. A numeric argument acts as a repeat count; a negative argument means to search backward and kill text before point. A history of previously used characters is maintained and can be accessed via the `M-p`/`M-n` keystrokes. This is mainly useful if the character to be used has to be entered via a complicated input method. A similar command `zap-up-to-char` kills from point up to, but not including the next occurrence of a character, with numeric argument acting as a repeat count.

slug: Outline-Views
---

You can display two views of a single outline at the same time, in different windows. To do this, you must create an indirect buffer using `M-x make-indirect-buffer`. The first argument of this command is the existing outline buffer name, and its second argument is the name to use for the new indirect buffer. See [Indirect Buffers](Indirect-Buffers).

Once the indirect buffer exists, you can display it in a window in the normal fashion, with `C-x 4 b` or other Emacs commands. The Outline mode commands to show and hide parts of the text operate on each buffer independently; as a result, each buffer can have its own view. If you want more than two views on the same outline, create additional indirect buffers.

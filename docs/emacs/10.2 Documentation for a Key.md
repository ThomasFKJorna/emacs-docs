The help commands to get information about a key sequence are `C-h c` (`describe-key-briefly`) and `C-h k` (`describe-key`).

`C-h c key` displays in the echo area the name of the command that `key` is bound to. For example, `C-h c C-f` displays ‘`forward-char`’.

`C-h k key` is similar but gives more information: it displays a help buffer containing the command’s *documentation string*, which describes exactly what the command does.

`C-h K key` displays the section of the Emacs manual that describes the command corresponding to `key`.

`C-h c`, `C-h k` and `C-h K` work for any sort of key sequences, including function keys, menus, and mouse events (except that `C-h c` ignores mouse movement events). For instance, after `C-h k` you can select a menu item from the menu bar, to view the documentation string of the command it runs.

`C-h w command RET` lists the keys that are bound to `command`. It displays the list in the echo area. If it says the command is not on any key, that means you must use `M-x` to run it. `C-h w` runs the command `where-is`.

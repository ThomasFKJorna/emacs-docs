The GUD (Grand Unified Debugger) library provides an Emacs interface to a wide variety of symbolic debuggers. It can run the GNU Debugger (GDB), as well as DBX, SDB, XDB, Guile REPL debug commands, Perl’s debugging mode, the Python debugger PDB, and the Java Debugger JDB.

Emacs provides a special interface to GDB, which uses extra Emacs windows to display the state of the debugged program. See [GDB Graphical Interface](GDB-Graphical-Interface).

Emacs also has a built-in debugger for Emacs Lisp programs. See [The Lisp Debugger](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/elisp.html#Debugging) in the Emacs Lisp Reference Manual.

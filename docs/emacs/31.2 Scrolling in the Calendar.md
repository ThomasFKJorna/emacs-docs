The calendar display scrolls automatically through time when you move out of the visible portion. You can also scroll it manually. Imagine that the calendar window contains a long strip of paper with the months on it. Scrolling the calendar means moving the strip horizontally, so that new months become visible in the window.

### `>`

Scroll calendar one month forward (`calendar-scroll-left`).

### `<`

Scroll calendar one month backward (`calendar-scroll-right`).

### `C-v`

### `PageDown`

### `next`

Scroll forward by three months (`calendar-scroll-left-three-months`).

### `M-v`

### `PageUp`

### `prior`

Scroll backward by three months (`calendar-scroll-right-three-months`).

The most basic calendar scroll commands scroll by one month at a time. This means that there are two months of overlap between the display before the command and the display after. `>` scrolls the calendar contents one month forward in time. `<` scrolls the contents one month backwards in time.

The commands `C-v` and `M-v` scroll the calendar by an entire screenful—three months—in analogy with the usual meaning of these commands. `C-v` makes later dates visible and `M-v` makes earlier dates visible. These commands take a numeric argument as a repeat count; in particular, since `C-u` multiplies the next command by four, typing `C-u C-v` scrolls the calendar forward by a year and typing `C-u M-v` scrolls the calendar backward by a year.

The function keys `PageDown` (or `next`) and `PageUp` (or `prior`) are equivalent to `C-v` and `M-v`, just as they are in other modes.

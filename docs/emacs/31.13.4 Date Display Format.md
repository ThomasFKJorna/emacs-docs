slug: Date-Display-Format
---

You can customize the way dates are displayed in the diary, mode lines, and messages by setting `calendar-date-display-form`. This variable holds a list of expressions that can involve the variables `month`, `day`, and `year`, which are all numbers in string form, and `monthname` and `dayname`, which are both alphabetic strings. In the American style, the default value of this list is as follows:

```lisp
((if dayname (concat dayname ", ")) monthname " " day ", " year)
```

while in the European style this value is the default:

```lisp
((if dayname (concat dayname ", ")) day " " monthname " " year)
```

The default ISO date representation is:

```lisp
((format "%s-%.2d-%.2d" year (string-to-number month)
         (string-to-number day)))
```

Another typical American format is:

```lisp
(month "/" day "/" (substring year -2))
```

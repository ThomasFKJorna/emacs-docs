slug: DocView-Slicing
---

Documents often have wide margins for printing. They are annoying when reading the document on the screen, because they use up screen space and can cause inconvenient scrolling.

With DocView you can hide these margins by selecting a *slice* of pages to display. A slice is a rectangle within the page area; once you specify a slice in DocView, it applies to whichever page you look at.

To specify the slice numerically, type `c s` (`doc-view-set-slice`); then enter the top left pixel position and the sliceâ€™s width and height.

A more convenient graphical way to specify the slice is with `c m` (`doc-view-set-slice-using-mouse`), where you use the mouse to select the slice. Simply press and hold the left mouse button at the upper-left corner of the region you want to have in the slice, then move the mouse pointer to the lower-right corner and release the button.

The most convenient way is to set the optimal slice by using BoundingBox information automatically determined from the document by typing `c b` (`doc-view-set-slice-from-bounding-box`).

To cancel the selected slice, type `c r` (`doc-view-reset-slice`). Then DocView shows the entire page including its entire margins.

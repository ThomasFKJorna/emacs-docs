*org* export back-end creates a normalized version of the Org document in current buffer. The exporter evaluates Babel code (see [Evaluating Code Blocks](Evaluating-Code-Blocks)) and removes content specific to other back-ends.

## Org export commands

### `C-c C-e O o` (`org-org-export-to-org`)

Export as an Org file with a ‘`.org`’ extension. For ‘`myfile.org`’, Org exports to ‘`myfile.org.org`’, overwriting without warning.

### `C-c C-e O v` (\~\~)

Export to an Org file, then open it.

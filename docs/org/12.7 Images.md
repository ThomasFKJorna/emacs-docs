An image is a link to an image file[^1] that does not have a description part, for example

```lisp
./img/cat.jpg
```

If you wish to define a caption for the image (see [Captions](Captions)) and maybe a label for internal cross references (see [Internal Links](Internal-Links)), make sure that the link is on a line by itself and precede it with ‘`CAPTION`’ and ‘`NAME`’ keywords as follows:

```lisp
#+CAPTION: This is the caption for the next figure link (or table)
#+NAME:   fig:SED-HR4049
[[./img/a.jpg]]
```

Such images can be displayed within the buffer with the following command:

### `C-c C-x C-v` (`org-toggle-inline-images`)

Toggle the inline display of linked images. When called with a prefix argument, also display images that do have a link description. You can ask for inline images to be displayed at startup by configuring the variable `org-startup-with-inline-images`[^2].

[^1]: What Emacs considers to be an image depends on `image-file-name-extensions` and `image-file-name-regexps`.

[^2]: The variable `org-startup-with-inline-images` can be set within a buffer with the ‘`STARTUP`’ options ‘`inlineimages`’ and ‘`noinlineimages`’.

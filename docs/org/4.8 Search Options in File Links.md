File links can contain additional information to make Emacs jump to a particular location in the file when following a link. This can be a line number or a search option after a double colon[^1]. For example, when the command `org-store-link` creates a link (see [Handling Links](/docs/org/Handling-Links)) to a file, it encodes the words in the current line as a search string that can be used to find this line back later when following the link with `C-c C-o`.

Note that all search options apply for Attachment links in the same way that they apply for File links.

Here is the syntax of the different ways to attach a search to a file link, together with explanations for each:

```lisp
[[file:~/code/main.c::255]]
[[file:~/xx.org::My Target]]
[[file:~/xx.org::*My Target]]
[[file:~/xx.org::#my-custom-id]]
[[file:~/xx.org::/regexp/]]
[[attachment:main.c::255]]
```

### ‘`255`’

Jump to line 255.

### ‘`My Target`’

Search for a link target ‘`<<My Target>>`’, or do a text search for ‘`my target`’, similar to the search in internal links, see [Internal Links](/docs/org/Internal-Links). In HTML export (see [HTML Export](/docs/org/HTML-Export)), such a file link becomes a HTML reference to the corresponding named anchor in the linked file.

### ‘`*My Target`’

In an Org file, restrict search to headlines.

### ‘`#my-custom-id`’

Link to a heading with a ‘`CUSTOM_ID`’ property

### ‘`/REGEXP/`’

Do a regular expression search for `REGEXP`. This uses the Emacs command `occur` to list all matches in a separate window. If the target file is in Org mode, `org-occur` is used to create a sparse tree with the matches.

As a degenerate case, a file link with an empty file name can be used to search the current file. For example, ‘`[[file:::find me]]`’ does a search for ‘`find me`’ in the current file, just as ‘`[[find me]]`’ would.

[^1]: For backward compatibility, line numbers can also follow a single colon.

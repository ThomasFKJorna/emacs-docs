slug: Radio-Targets
---

Org can automatically turn any occurrences of certain target names in normal text into a link. So without explicitly creating a link, the text connects to the target radioing its position. Radio targets are enclosed by triple angular brackets. For example, a target ‘`<<<My Target>>>`’ causes each occurrence of ‘`my target`’ in normal text to become activated as a link. The Org file is scanned automatically for radio targets only when the file is first loaded into Emacs. To update the target list during editing, press `C-c C-c` with point on or at a target.

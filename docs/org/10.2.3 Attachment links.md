Attached files and folders can be referenced using attachment links. This makes it easy to refer to the material added to an outline node. Especially if it was attached using the unique ID of the entry!

```lisp
* TODO Some task
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ID:       95d50008-c12e-479f-a4f2-cc0238205319
  :END:

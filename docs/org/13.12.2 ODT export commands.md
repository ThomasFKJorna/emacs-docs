### `C-c C-e o o` (`org-export-to-odt`)

Export as OpenDocument Text file.

If `org-odt-preferred-output-format` is specified, the ODT export back-end automatically converts the exported file to that format.

For ‘`myfile.org`’, Org exports to ‘`myfile.odt`’, overwriting without warning. The ODT export back-end exports a region only if a region was active.

If the selected region is a single tree, the ODT export back-end makes the tree head the document title. Incidentally, `C-c @` selects the current sub-tree. If the tree head entry has, or inherits, an ‘`EXPORT_FILE_NAME`’ property, the ODT export back-end uses that for file name.

### `C-c C-e o O`

Export as an OpenDocument Text file and open the resulting file.

If `org-export-odt-preferred-output-format` is specified, open the converted file instead. See [Automatically exporting to other formats](Automatically-exporting-to-other-formats).

The ODT export back-end has several additional keywords for customizing ODT output. Setting these keywords works similar to the general options (see [Export Settings](Export-Settings)).

### ‘`DESCRIPTION`’

This is the document’s description, which the ODT export back-end inserts as document metadata. For long descriptions, use multiple lines, prefixed with ‘`DESCRIPTION`’.

### ‘`KEYWORDS`’

The keywords for the document. The ODT export back-end inserts the description along with author name, keywords, and related file metadata as metadata in the output file. Use multiple ‘`KEYWORDS`’ if necessary.

### ‘`ODT_STYLES_FILE`’

The ODT export back-end uses the `org-odt-styles-file` by default. See [Applying custom styles](Applying-custom-styles) for details.

### ‘`SUBTITLE`’

The document subtitle.

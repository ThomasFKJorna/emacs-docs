Once a system of tags has been set up, it can be used to collect related information into special lists.

### `C-c / m` or `C-c \` (`org-match-sparse-tree`)

Create a sparse tree with all headlines matching a tags search. With a `C-u` prefix argument, ignore headlines that are not a TODO line.

### `M-x org-agenda m` (`org-tags-view`)

Create a global list of tag matches from all agenda files. See [Matching tags and properties](Matching-tags-and-properties).

### `M-x org-agenda M` (`org-tags-view`)

Create a global list of tag matches from all agenda files, but check only TODO items and force checking subitems (see the option `org-tags-match-list-sublevels`).

These commands all prompt for a match string which allows basic Boolean logic like ‘`+boss+urgent-project1`’, to find entries with tags ‘`boss`’ and ‘`urgent`’, but not ‘`project1`’, or ‘`Kathy|Sally`’ to find entries which are tagged, like ‘`Kathy`’ or ‘`Sally`’. The full syntax of the search string is rich and allows also matching against TODO keywords, entry levels and properties. For a complete description with many examples, see [Matching tags and properties](Matching-tags-and-properties).

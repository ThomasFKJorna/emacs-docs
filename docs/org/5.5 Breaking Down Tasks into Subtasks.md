slug: Breaking-Down-Tasks

It is often advisable to break down large tasks into smaller, manageable subtasks. You can do this by creating an outline tree below a TODO item, with detailed subtasks on the tree[^1]. To keep an overview of the fraction of subtasks that have already been marked as done, insert either ‘`[/]`’ or ‘`[%]`’ anywhere in the headline. These cookies are updated each time the TODO status of a child changes, or when pressing `C-c C-c` on the cookie. For example:

```lisp
* Organize Party [33%]
** TODO Call people [1/2]
*** TODO Peter
*** DONE Sarah
** TODO Buy food
** DONE Talk to neighbor
```

If a heading has both checkboxes and TODO children below it, the meaning of the statistics cookie become ambiguous. Set the property ‘`COOKIE_DATA`’ to either ‘`checkbox`’ or ‘`todo`’ to resolve this issue.

If you would like to have the statistics cookie count any TODO entries in the subtree (not just direct children), configure the variable `org-hierarchical-todo-statistics`. To do this for a single subtree, include the word ‘`recursive`’ into the value of the ‘`COOKIE_DATA`’ property.

```lisp
* Parent capturing statistics [2/20]
  :PROPERTIES:
  :COOKIE_DATA: todo recursive
  :END:
```

If you would like a TODO entry to automatically change to DONE when all children are done, you can use the following setup:

```lisp
(defun org-summary-todo (n-done n-not-done)
  "Switch entry to DONE when all subentries are done, to TODO otherwise."
  (let (org-log-done org-log-states)   ; turn off logging
    (org-todo (if (= n-not-done 0) "DONE" "TODO"))))

(add-hook 'org-after-todo-statistics-hook 'org-summary-todo)
```

Another possibility is the use of checkboxes to identify (a hierarchy of) a large number of subtasks (see [Checkboxes](/docs/org/Checkboxes)).

[^1]: To keep subtasks out of the global TODO list, see the option `org-agenda-todo-list-sublevels`.

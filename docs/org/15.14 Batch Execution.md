Org mode features, including working with source code facilities can be invoked from the command line. This enables building shell scripts for batch processing, running automated system tasks, and expanding Org modeâ€™s usefulness.

The sample script shows batch processing of multiple files using `org-babel-tangle`.

```lisp
#!/bin/sh
# Tangle files with Org mode
#
emacs -Q --batch --eval "
    (progn
      (require 'ob-tangle)
      (dolist (file command-line-args-left)
        (with-current-buffer (find-file-noselect file)
          (org-babel-tangle))))
  " "$@"
```

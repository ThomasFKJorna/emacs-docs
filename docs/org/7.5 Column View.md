A great way to view and edit properties in an outline tree is *column view*. In column view, each outline node is turned into a table row. Columns in this table provide access to properties of the entries. Org mode implements columns by overlaying a tabular structure over the headline of each item. While the headlines have been turned into a table row, you can still change the visibility of the outline tree. For example, you get a compact table by switching to “contents" view—`S-TAB` `S-TAB`, or simply `c` while column view is active—but you can still open, read, and edit the entry below each headline. Or, you can switch to column view after executing a sparse tree command and in this way get a table only for the selected items. Column view also works in agenda buffers (see [Agenda Views](Agenda-Views)) where queries have collected selected items, possibly from a number of files.

To create sparse trees and special lists with selection based on properties, the same commands are used as for tag searches (see [Tag Searches](/docs/org/Tag-Searches)).

### `C-c / m` or `C-c \` (`org-match-sparse-tree`)

Create a sparse tree with all matching entries. With a `C-u` prefix argument, ignore headlines that are not a TODO line.

### `M-x org-agenda m` (`org-tags-view`)

Create a global list of tag/property matches from all agenda files.

### `M-x org-agenda M` (`org-tags-view`)

Create a global list of tag matches from all agenda files, but check only TODO items and force checking of subitems (see the option `org-tags-match-list-sublevels`).

The syntax for the search string is described in [Matching tags and properties](/docs/org/Matching-tags-and-properties).

There is also a special command for creating sparse trees based on a single property:

### `C-c / p`

Create a sparse tree based on the value of a property. This first prompts for the name of a property, and then for a value. A sparse tree is created with all entries that define this property with the given value. If you enclose the value in curly braces, it is interpreted as a regular expression and matched against the property values.

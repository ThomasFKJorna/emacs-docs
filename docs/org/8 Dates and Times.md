To assist project planning, TODO items can be labeled with a date and/or a time. The specially formatted string carrying the date and time information is called a *timestamp* in Org mode. This may be a little confusing because timestamp is often used as indicating when something was created or last changed. However, in Org mode this term is used in a much wider sense.

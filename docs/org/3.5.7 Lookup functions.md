Org has three predefined Emacs Lisp functions for lookups in tables.

### ‘`(org-lookup-first VAL S-LIST R-LIST &optional PREDICATE)`’

Searches for the first element `S` in list `S-LIST` for which

```lisp
(PREDICATE VAL S)
```

is non-`nil`; returns the value from the corresponding position in list `R-LIST`. The default `PREDICATE` is `equal`. Note that the parameters `VAL` and `S` are passed to `PREDICATE` in the same order as the corresponding parameters are in the call to `org-lookup-first`, where `VAL` precedes `S-LIST`. If `R-LIST` is `nil`, the matching element `S` of `S-LIST` is returned.

### ‘`(org-lookup-last VAL S-LIST R-LIST &optional PREDICATE)`’

Similar to `org-lookup-first` above, but searches for the *last* element for which `PREDICATE` is non-`nil`.

### ‘`(org-lookup-all VAL S-LIST R-LIST &optional PREDICATE)`’

Similar to `org-lookup-first`, but searches for *all* elements for which `PREDICATE` is non-`nil`, and returns *all* corresponding values. This function can not be used by itself in a formula, because it returns a list of values. However, powerful lookups can be built when this function is combined with other Emacs Lisp functions.

If the ranges used in these functions contain empty fields, the ‘`E`’ mode for the formula should usually be specified: otherwise empty fields are not included in `S-LIST` and/or `R-LIST` which can, for example, result in an incorrect mapping from an element of `S-LIST` to the corresponding element of `R-LIST`.

These three functions can be used to implement associative arrays, count matching cells, rank results, group data, etc. For practical examples see [this tutorial on Worg](https://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-lookups.html).

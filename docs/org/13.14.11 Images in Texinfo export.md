Insert a file link to the image in the Org file, and the Texinfo export back-end inserts the image. These links must have the usual supported image extensions and no descriptions. To scale the image, use ‘`:width`’ and ‘`:height`’ attributes. For alternate text, use ‘`:alt`’ and specify the text using Texinfo code, as shown in the example:

```lisp
#+ATTR_TEXINFO: :width 1in :alt Alternate @i{text}
[[ridt.pdf]]
```

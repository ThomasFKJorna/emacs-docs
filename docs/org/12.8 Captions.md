slug: Captions

You can assign a caption to a specific part of a document by inserting a ‘`CAPTION`’ keyword immediately before it:

```lisp
#+CAPTION: This is the caption for the next table (or link)
| ... | ... |
|-----+-----|
```

Optionally, the caption can take the form:

```lisp
#+CAPTION[Short caption]: Longer caption.
```

Even though images and tables are prominent examples of captioned structures, the same caption mechanism can apply to many others—e.g., LaTeX equations, source code blocks. Depending on the export back-end, those may or may not be handled.

You can use TODO keywords to indicate different, possibly *sequential* states in the process of working on an item, for example[^1]:

```lisp
(setq org-todo-keywords
      '((sequence "TODO" "FEEDBACK" "VERIFY" "|" "DONE" "DELEGATED")))
```

The vertical bar separates the TODO keywords (states that *need action*) from the DONE states (which need *no further action*). If you do not provide the separator bar, the last state is used as the DONE state.

With this setup, the command `C-c C-t` cycles an entry from ‘`TODO`’ to ‘`FEEDBACK`’, then to ‘`VERIFY`’, and finally to ‘`DONE`’ and ‘`DELEGATED`’. You may also use a numeric prefix argument to quickly select a specific state. For example `C-3 C-c C-t` changes the state immediately to ‘`VERIFY`’. Or you can use `S-RIGHT` and `S-LEFT` to go forward and backward through the states. If you define many keywords, you can use in-buffer completion (see [Completion](Completion)) or a special one-key selection scheme (see [Fast access to TODO states](Fast-access-to-TODO-states)) to insert these words into the buffer. Changing a TODO state can be logged with a timestamp, see [Tracking TODO state changes](Tracking-TODO-state-changes), for more information.

[^1]: Changing the variable `org-todo-keywords` only becomes effective after restarting Org mode in a buffer.

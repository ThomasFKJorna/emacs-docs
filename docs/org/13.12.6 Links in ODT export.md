ODT exporter creates native cross-references for internal links. It creates Internet-style links for all other links.

A link with no description and pointing to a regular, un-itemized, outline heading is replaced with a cross-reference and section number of the heading.

A ‘`\ref{label}`’-style reference to an image, table etc., is replaced with a cross-reference and sequence number of the labeled entity. See [Labels and captions in ODT export](/docs/org/Labels-and-captions-in-ODT-export).

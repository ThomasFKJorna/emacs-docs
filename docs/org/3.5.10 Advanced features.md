If you want the recalculation of fields to happen automatically, or if you want to be able to assign *names*[^1] to fields and columns, you need to reserve the first column of the table for special marking characters.

### `C-#` (`org-table-rotate-recalc-marks`)

Rotate the calculation mark in first column through the states ‘`#`’, ‘`*`’, ‘`!`’, ‘`$`’. When there is an active region, change all marks in the region.

Here is an example of a table that collects exam results of students and makes use of these features:

```lisp
|---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
|   | Student | Prob 1 | Prob 2 | Prob 3 | Total | Note |
|---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
| ! |         |     P1 |     P2 |     P3 |   Tot |      |
| # | Maximum |     10 |     15 |     25 |    50 | 10.0 |
| ^ |         |     m1 |     m2 |     m3 |    mt |      |
|---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
| # | Peter   |     10 |      8 |     23 |    41 |  8.2 |
| # | Sam     |      2 |      4 |      3 |     9 |  1.8 |
|---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
|   | Average |        |        |        |  25.0 |      |
| ^ |         |        |        |        |    at |      |
| $ | max=50  |        |        |        |       |      |
|---+---------+--------+--------+--------+-------+------|
#+TBLFM: $6=vsum($P1..$P3)::$7=10*$Tot/$max;%.1f::$at=vmean(@-II..@-I);%.1f
```

> **Important:** Please note that for these special tables, recalculating the table with `C-u C-c *` only affects rows that are marked ‘`#`’ or ‘`*`’, and fields that have a formula assigned to the field itself. The column formulas are not applied in rows with empty first field.

The marking characters have the following meaning:

### ‘`!`’

The fields in this line define names for the columns, so that you may refer to a column as ‘`$Tot`’ instead of ‘`$6`’.

### ‘`^`’

This row defines names for the fields *above* the row. With such a definition, any formula in the table may use ‘`$m1`’ to refer to the value ‘`10`’. Also, if you assign a formula to a names field, it is stored as ‘`$name = ...`’.

### ‘`_`’

Similar to ‘`^`’, but defines names for the fields in the row *below*.

### ‘`$`’

Fields in this row can define *parameters* for formulas. For example, if a field in a ‘`$`’ row contains ‘`max=50`’, then formulas in this table can refer to the value 50 using ‘`$max`’. Parameters work exactly like constants, only that they can be defined on a per-table basis.

### ‘`#`’

Fields in this row are automatically recalculated when pressing `TAB` or `RET` or `S-TAB` in this row. Also, this row is selected for a global recalculation with `C-u C-c *`. Unmarked lines are left alone by this command.

### ‘`*`’

Selects this line for global recalculation with `C-u C-c *`, but not for automatic recalculation. Use this when automatic recalculation slows down editing too much.

### ‘`/`’

Do not export this line. Useful for lines that contain the narrowing ‘`<N>`’ markers or column group markers.

Finally, just to whet your appetite for what can be done with the fantastic Calc package, here is a table that computes the Taylor series of degree n at location x for a couple of functions.

```lisp
|---+-------------+---+-----+--------------------------------------|
|   | Func        | n | x   | Result                               |
|---+-------------+---+-----+--------------------------------------|
| # | exp(x)      | 1 | x   | 1 + x                                |
| # | exp(x)      | 2 | x   | 1 + x + x^2 / 2                      |
| # | exp(x)      | 3 | x   | 1 + x + x^2 / 2 + x^3 / 6            |
| # | x^2+sqrt(x) | 2 | x=0 | x*(0.5 / 0) + x^2 (2 - 0.25 / 0) / 2 |
| # | x^2+sqrt(x) | 2 | x=1 | 2 + 2.5 x - 2.5 + 0.875 (x - 1)^2    |
| * | tan(x)      | 3 | x   | 0.0175 x + 1.77e-6 x^3               |
|---+-------------+---+-----+--------------------------------------|
#+TBLFM: $5=taylor($2,$4,$3);n3
```

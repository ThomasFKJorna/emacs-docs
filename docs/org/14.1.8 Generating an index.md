slug: Generating-an-index

Org mode can generate an index across the files of a publishing project.

### <span className="tag :makeindex">`:makeindex`</span>``

When non-`nil`, generate in index in the file ‘`theindex.org`’ and publish it as ‘`theindex.html`’.

The file is created when first publishing a project with the `:makeindex` set. The file only contains a statement ‘`#+INCLUDE: "theindex.inc"`’. You can then build around this include statement by adding a title, style information, etc.

Index entries are specified with ‘`INDEX`’ keyword. An entry that contains an exclamation mark creates a sub item.

An excellent way to implement labels and contexts for cross-correlating information is to assign *tags* to headlines. Org mode has extensive support for tags.

Every headline can contain a list of tags; they occur at the end of the headline. Tags are normal words containing letters, numbers, ‘`_`’, and ‘`@`’. Tags must be preceded and followed by a single colon, e.g., ‘`:work:`’. Several tags can be specified, as in ‘`:work:urgent:`’. Tags by default are in bold face with the same color as the headline. You may specify special faces for specific tags using the variable `org-tag-faces`, in much the same way as you can for TODO keywords (see [Faces for TODO keywords](Faces-for-TODO-keywords)).

You can modify the CSS style definitions for the exported file. The HTML exporter assigns the following special CSS classes[^1] to appropriate parts of the document—your style specifications may change these, in addition to any of the standard classes like for headlines, tables, etc.

|                      |                                                         |

The HTML export back-end includes a compact default style in each exported HTML file. To override the default style with another style, use these keywords in the Org file. They will replace the global defaults the HTML exporter uses.

```lisp
#+HTML_HEAD: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style1.css" />
#+HTML_HEAD_EXTRA: <link rel="alternate stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style2.css" />
```

To just turn off the default style, customize `org-html-head-include-default-style` variable, or use this option line in the Org file.

```lisp
#+OPTIONS: html-style:nil
```

For longer style definitions, either use several ‘`HTML_HEAD`’ and ‘`HTML_HEAD_EXTRA`’ keywords, or use `<style> ... </style>` blocks around them. Both of these approaches can avoid referring to an external file.

In order to add styles to a sub-tree, use the ‘`HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS`’ property to assign a class to the tree. In order to specify CSS styles for a particular headline, you can use the ID specified in a ‘`CUSTOM_ID`’ property. You can also assign a specific class to a headline with the ‘`HTML_HEADLINE_CLASS`’ property.

Never change the `org-html-style-default` constant. Instead use other simpler ways of customizing as described above.

[^1]: If the classes on TODO keywords and tags lead to conflicts, use the variables `org-html-todo-kwd-class-prefix` and `org-html-tag-class-prefix` to make them unique.

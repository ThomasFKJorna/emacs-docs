Sometimes you may want to use different sets of TODO keywords in parallel. For example, you may want to have the basic TODO/DONE, but also a workflow for bug fixing, and a separate state indicating that an item has been canceled—so it is not DONE, but also does not require action. Your setup would then look like this:

```lisp
(setq org-todo-keywords
      '((sequence "TODO" "|" "DONE")
        (sequence "REPORT" "BUG" "KNOWNCAUSE" "|" "FIXED")
        (sequence "|" "CANCELED")))
```

The keywords should all be different, this helps Org mode keep track of which subsequence should be used for a given entry. In this setup, `C-c C-t` only operates within a sub-sequence, so it switches from ‘`DONE`’ to (nothing) to ‘`TODO`’, and from ‘`FIXED`’ to (nothing) to ‘`REPORT`’. Therefore you need a mechanism to initially select the correct sequence. In addition to typing a keyword or using completion (see [Completion](/docs/org/Completion)), you may also apply the following commands:

### `C-u C-u C-c C-t`

### `C-S-RIGHT`

### `C-S-LEFT`

These keys jump from one TODO sub-sequence to the next. In the above example, `C-u C-u C-c C-t` or `C-S-RIGHT` would jump from ‘`TODO`’ or ‘`DONE`’ to ‘`REPORT`’, and any of the words in the second row to ‘`CANCELED`’. Note that the `C-S-` key binding conflict with shift-selection (see [Conflicts](/docs/org/Conflicts)).

### `S-RIGHT`

### `S-LEFT`

`S-LEFT` and `S-RIGHT` walk through *all* keywords from all sub-sequences, so for example `S-RIGHT` would switch from ‘`DONE`’ to ‘`REPORT`’ in the example above. For a discussion of the interaction with shift-selection, see [Conflicts](/docs/org/Conflicts).

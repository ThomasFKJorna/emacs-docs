Since Org’s Beamer export back-end is an extension of the LaTeX back-end, it recognizes other LaTeX specific syntax—for example, ‘`#+LATEX:`’ or ‘`#+ATTR_LATEX:`’. See [LaTeX Export](LaTeX-Export), for details.

Beamer export wraps the table of contents generated with ‘`toc:t`’ ‘`OPTION`’ keyword in a ‘`frame`’ environment. Beamer export does not wrap the table of contents generated with ‘`TOC`’ keyword (see [Table of Contents](Table-of-Contents)). Use square brackets for specifying options.

```lisp
#+TOC: headlines [currentsection]
```

Insert Beamer-specific code using the following constructs:

```lisp
#+BEAMER: \pause

#+BEGIN_EXPORT beamer
  Only Beamer export back-end exports this.
#+END_BEAMER

Text @@beamer:some code@@ within a paragraph.
```

Inline constructs, such as the last one above, are useful for adding overlay specifications to objects with `bold`, `item`, `link`, `radio-target` and `target` types. Enclose the value in angular brackets and place the specification at the beginning of the object as shown in this example:

```lisp
A *@@beamer:<2->@@useful* feature
```

Beamer export recognizes the ‘`ATTR_BEAMER`’ keyword with the following attributes from Beamer configurations: ‘`:environment`’ for changing local Beamer environment, ‘`:overlay`’ for specifying Beamer overlays in angular or square brackets, and ‘`:options`’ for inserting optional arguments.

```lisp
#+ATTR_BEAMER: :environment nonindentlist
- item 1, not indented
- item 2, not indented
- item 3, not indented
```

```lisp
#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay <+->
- item 1
- item 2
```

```lisp
#+ATTR_BEAMER: :options [Lagrange]
Let $G$ be a finite group, and let $H$ be
a subgroup of $G$.  Then the order of $H$ divides the order of $G$.
```

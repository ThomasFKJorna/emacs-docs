ODT format handles labeling and captioning of objects based on their types. Inline images, tables, LaTeX fragments, and Math formulas are numbered and captioned separately. Each object also gets a unique sequence number based on its order of first appearance in the Org file. Each category has its own sequence. A caption is just a label applied to these objects.

```lisp
#+CAPTION: Bell curve
#+NAME:   fig:SED-HR4049
[[./img/a.png]]
```

When rendered, it may show as follows in the exported document:

```lisp
Figure 2: Bell curve
```

To modify the category component of the caption, customize the option `org-odt-category-map-alist`. For example, to tag embedded images with the string “Illustration" instead of the default string “Figure", use the following setting:

```lisp
(setq org-odt-category-map-alist
      '(("__Figure__" "Illustration" "value" "Figure" org-odt--enumerable-image-p)))
```

With the above modification, the previous example changes to:

```lisp
Illustration 2: Bell curve
```

Recalculation of a table is normally not automatic, but needs to be triggered by a command. To make recalculation at least semi-automatic, see [Advanced features](/docs/org/Advanced-features).

In order to recalculate a line of a table or the entire table, use the following commands:

### `C-c *` (`org-table-recalculate`)

Recalculate the current row by first applying the stored column formulas from left to right, and all field/range formulas in the current row.

### `C-u C-c *` or `C-u C-c C-c`

Recompute the entire table, line by line. Any lines before the first hline are left alone, assuming that these are part of the table header.

### `C-u C-u C-c *` or `C-u C-u C-c C-c` (`org-table-iterate`)

Iterate the table by recomputing it until no further changes occur. This may be necessary if some computed fields use the value of other fields that are computed *later* in the calculation sequence.

### `M-x org-table-recalculate-buffer-tables`

Recompute all tables in the current buffer.

### `M-x org-table-iterate-buffer-tables`

Iterate all tables in the current buffer, in order to converge table-to-table dependencies.

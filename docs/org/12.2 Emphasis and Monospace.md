You can make words ‘`*bold*`’, ‘`/italic/`’, ‘`_underlined_`’, ‘`=verbatim=`’ and ‘`~code~`’, and, if you must, ‘`+strike-through+`’. Text in the code and verbatim string is not processed for Org specific syntax; it is exported verbatim.

To turn off fontification for marked up text, you can set `org-fontify-emphasized-text` to `nil`. To narrow down the list of available markup syntax, you can customize `org-emphasis-alist`.

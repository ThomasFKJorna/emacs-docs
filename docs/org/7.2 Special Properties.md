Special properties provide an alternative access method to Org mode features, like the TODO state or the priority of an entry, discussed in the previous chapters. This interface exists so that you can include these states in a column view (see [Column View](Column-View)), or to use them in queries. The following property names are special and should not be used as keys in the properties drawer:

|                  |                                                                |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‘`ALLTAGS`’      | All tags, including inherited ones.                            |
| ‘`BLOCKED`’      | `t` if task is currently blocked by children or siblings.      |
| ‘`CATEGORY`’     | The category of an entry.                                      |
| ‘`CLOCKSUM`’     | The sum of CLOCK intervals in the subtree. `org-clock-sum`     |
|                  | must be run first to compute the values in the current buffer. |
| ‘`CLOCKSUM_T`’   | The sum of CLOCK intervals in the subtree for today.           |
|                  | `org-clock-sum-today` must be run first to compute the         |
|                  | values in the current buffer.                                  |

| ‘`TAGS`’         | The tags defined directly in the headline.                     |
| ‘`TIMESTAMP`’    | The first keyword-less timestamp in the entry.                 |
| ‘`TIMESTAMP_IA`’ | The first inactive timestamp in the entry.                     |

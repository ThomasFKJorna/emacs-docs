slug: Texinfo-file-header

After creating the header for a Texinfo file, the Texinfo back-end automatically generates a name and destination path for the Info file. To override this default with a more sensible path and name, specify the ‘`TEXINFO_FILENAME`’ keyword.

Along with the output’s file name, the Texinfo header also contains language details (see [Export Settings](Export-Settings)) and encoding system as set in the `org-texinfo-coding-system` variable. Insert ‘`TEXINFO_HEADER`’ keywords for each additional command in the header, for example:

```lisp
#+TEXINFO_HEADER: @synindex
```

Instead of repeatedly installing the same set of commands, define a class in `org-texinfo-classes` once, and then activate it in the document by setting the ‘`TEXINFO_CLASS`’ keyword to that class.

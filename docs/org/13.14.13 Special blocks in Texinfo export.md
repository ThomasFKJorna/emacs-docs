slug: Special-blocks-in-Texinfo-export
---

The Texinfo export back-end converts special blocks to commands with the same name. It also adds any ‘`:options`’ attributes to the end of the command, as shown in this example:

```lisp
#+ATTR_TEXINFO: :options org-org-export-to-org ...
#+BEGIN_defun
  A somewhat obsessive function name.
#+END_defun
```

becomes

```lisp
@defun org-org-export-to-org ...
  A somewhat obsessive function name.
@end defun
```

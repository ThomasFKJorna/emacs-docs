### `C-c C-e l l` (`org-latex-export-to-latex`)

Export to a LaTeX file with a ‘`.tex`’ extension. For ‘`myfile.org`’, Org exports to ‘`myfile.tex`’, overwriting without warning.

### `C-c C-e l L` (`org-latex-export-as-latex`)

Export to a temporary buffer. Do not create a file.

### `C-c C-e l p` (`org-latex-export-to-pdf`)

Export as LaTeX file and convert it to PDF file.

### `C-c C-e l o`

Export as LaTeX file and convert it to PDF, then open the PDF using the default viewer.

### `M-x org-export-region-as-latex`

Convert the region to LaTeX under the assumption that it was in Org mode syntax before. This is a global command that can be invoked in any buffer.

The LaTeX export back-end can use any of these LaTeX engines: ‘`pdflatex`’, ‘`xelatex`’, and ‘`lualatex`’. These engines compile LaTeX files with different compilers, packages, and output options. The LaTeX export back-end finds the compiler version to use from `org-latex-compiler` variable or the ‘`#+LATEX_COMPILER`’ keyword in the Org file. See the docstring for the `org-latex-default-packages-alist` for loading packages with certain compilers. Also see `org-latex-bibtex-compiler` to set the bibliography compiler[^1].

[^1]: This does not allow setting different bibliography compilers for different files. However, “smart" LaTeX compilation systems, such as latexmk, can select the correct bibliography compiler.

Using the `store-link` handler, you can copy links, to that they can be inserted using `M-x org-insert-link` or yanking. More precisely, the command

```lisp
emacsclient org-protocol://store-link?url=URL&title=TITLE
```

stores the following link:

```lisp
[[URL][TITLE]]
```

In addition, `URL` is pushed on the kill-ring for yanking. You need to encode `URL` and `TITLE` if they contain slashes, and probably quote those for the shell.

To use this feature from a browser, add a bookmark with an arbitrary name, e.g., ‘`Org: store-link`’ and enter this as *Location*:

```lisp
javascript:location.href='org-protocol://store-link?url='+
      encodeURIComponent(location.href);
```

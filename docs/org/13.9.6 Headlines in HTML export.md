slug: Headlines-in-HTML-export

Headlines are exported to ‘`<h1>`’, ‘`<h2>`’, etc. Each headline gets the ‘`id`’ attribute from ‘`CUSTOM_ID`’ property, or a unique generated value, see [Internal Links](/docs/org/Internal-Links).

When `org-html-self-link-headlines` is set to a non-`nil` value, the text of the headlines is also wrapped in ‘`<a>`’ tags. These tags have a ‘`href`’ attribute making the headlines link to themselves.

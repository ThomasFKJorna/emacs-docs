slug: Hard-indentation
---

It is possible to use hard spaces to achieve the indentation instead, if the bare ASCII file should have the indented look also outside Emacs[^1]. With Org’s support, you have to indent all lines to line up with the outline headers. You would use these settings[^2]:

```lisp
(setq org-adapt-indentation t
      org-hide-leading-stars t
      org-odd-levels-only t)
```

### *Indentation of text below headlines* (`org-adapt-indentation`)

The first setting modifies paragraph filling, line wrapping, and structure editing commands to preserving or adapting the indentation as appropriate.

### *Hiding leading stars* (`org-hide-leading-stars`)

The second setting makes leading stars invisible by applying the face `org-hide` to them. For per-file preference, use these file ‘`STARTUP`’ options:

```lisp
#+STARTUP: hidestars
#+STARTUP: showstars
```

### *Odd levels* (`org-odd-levels-only`)

The third setting makes Org use only odd levels, 1, 3, 5, …, in the outline to create more indentation. On a per-file level, control this with:

```lisp
#+STARTUP: odd
#+STARTUP: oddeven
```

To convert a file between single and double stars layouts, use `M-x org-convert-to-odd-levels` and `M-x org-convert-to-oddeven-levels`.

[^1]: This works, but requires extra effort. Org Indent mode is more convenient for most applications.

[^2]: `org-adapt-indentation` can also be set to ‘`'headline-data`’, in which case only data lines below the headline will be indented.

Another possibility is the construction of agenda views that comprise the results of *several* commands, each of which creates a block in the agenda buffer. The available commands include `agenda` for the daily or weekly agenda (as created with `a`) , `alltodo` for the global TODO list (as constructed with `t`), `stuck` for the list of stuck projects (as obtained with `#`) and the matching commands discussed above: `todo`, `tags`, and `tags-todo`.

Here are two examples:

```lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("h" "Agenda and Home-related tasks"
         ((agenda "")
          (tags-todo "home")
          (tags "garden")))
        ("o" "Agenda and Office-related tasks"
         ((agenda "")
          (tags-todo "work")
          (tags "office")))))
```

This defines `h` to create a multi-block view for stuff you need to attend to at home. The resulting agenda buffer contains your agenda for the current week, all TODO items that carry the tag ‘`home`’, and also all lines tagged with ‘`garden`’. Finally the command `o` provides a similar view for office tasks.

Before displaying items in an agenda view, Org mode visually prepares the items and sorts them. Each item occupies a single line. The line starts with a *prefix* that contains the *category* (see [Categories](/docs/org/Categories)) of the item and other important information. You can customize in which column tags are displayed through `org-agenda-tags-column`. You can also customize the prefix using the option `org-agenda-prefix-format`. This prefix is followed by a cleaned-up version of the outline headline associated with the item.

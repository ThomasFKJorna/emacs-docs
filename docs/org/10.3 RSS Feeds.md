Org can add and change entries based on information found in RSS feeds and Atom feeds. You could use this to make a task out of each new podcast in a podcast feed. Or you could use a phone-based note-creating service on the web to import tasks into Org. To access feeds, configure the variable `org-feed-alist`. The docstring of this variable has detailed information. With the following

```lisp
(setq org-feed-alist
      '(("Slashdot"
         "http://rss.slashdot.org/Slashdot/slashdot"
         "~/txt/org/feeds.org" "Slashdot Entries")))
```

new items from the feed provided by ‘`rss.slashdot.org`’ result in new entries in the file ‘`~/org/feeds.org`’ under the heading ‘`Slashdot Entries`’, whenever the following command is used:

### `C-c C-x g` (`org-feed-update-all`)

Collect items from the feeds configured in `org-feed-alist` and act upon them.

### `C-c C-x G` (`org-feed-goto-inbox`)

Prompt for a feed name and go to the inbox configured for this feed.

Under the same headline, Org creates a drawer ‘`FEEDSTATUS`’ in which it stores information about the status of items in the feed, to avoid adding the same item several times.

For more information, including how to read atom feeds, see ‘`org-feed.el`’ and the docstring of `org-feed-alist`.

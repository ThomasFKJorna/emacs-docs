By default, all files with extension ‘`.org`’ in the base directory are considered part of the project. This can be modified by setting the following properties

### `:base-extension`

Extension—without the dot—of source files. This actually is a regular expression. Set this to the symbol `any` if you want to get all files in `:base-directory`, even without extension.

### `:exclude`

Regular expression to match file names that should not be published, even though they have been selected on the basis of their extension.

### `:include`

List of files to be included regardless of `:base-extension` and `:exclude`.

### `:recursive`

Non-`nil` means, check base-directory recursively for files to publish.

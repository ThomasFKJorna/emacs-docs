slug: Blocks
---

Org mode uses ‘`#+BEGIN`’ … ‘`#+END`’ blocks for various purposes from including source code examples (see [Literal Examples](/docs/org/Literal-Examples)) to capturing time logging information (see [Clocking Work Time](/docs/org/Clocking-Work-Time)). These blocks can be folded and unfolded by pressing `TAB` in the ‘`#+BEGIN`’ line. You can also get all blocks folded at startup by configuring the variable `org-hide-block-startup` or on a per-file basis by using

```lisp
#+STARTUP: hideblocks
#+STARTUP: nohideblocks
```

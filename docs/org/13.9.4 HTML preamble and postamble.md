slug: HTML-preamble-and-postamble
---

The HTML exporter has delineations for preamble and postamble. The default value for `org-html-preamble` is `t`, which makes the HTML exporter insert the preamble. See the variable `org-html-preamble-format` for the format string.

Set `org-html-preamble` to a string to override the default format string. If the string is a function, the HTML exporter expects the function to return a string upon execution. The HTML exporter inserts this string in the preamble. The HTML exporter does not insert a preamble if `org-html-preamble` is set `nil`.

The default value for `org-html-postamble` is `auto`, which makes the HTML exporter build a postamble from looking up author’s name, email address, creator’s name, and date. Set `org-html-postamble` to `t` to insert the postamble in the format specified in the `org-html-postamble-format` variable. The HTML exporter does not insert a postamble if `org-html-postamble` is set to `nil`.

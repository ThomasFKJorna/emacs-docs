Most properties are optional, but some should always be set. In particular, Org needs to know where to look for source files, and where to put published files.

### `:base-directory`

Directory containing publishing source files.

### `:publishing-directory`

Directory where output files are published. You can directly publish to a webserver using a file name syntax appropriate for the Emacs tramp package. Or you can publish to a local directory and use external tools to upload your website (see [Uploading Files](/docs/org/Uploading-Files)).

### `:preparation-function`

Function or list of functions to be called before starting the publishing process, for example, to run ‘`make`’ for updating files to be published. Each preparation function is called with a single argument, the project property list.

### `:completion-function`

Function or list of functions called after finishing the publishing process, for example, to change permissions of the resulting files. Each completion function is called with a single argument, the project property list.

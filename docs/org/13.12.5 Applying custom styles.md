The ODT export back-end comes with many OpenDocument styles (see [Working with OpenDocument style files](Working-with-OpenDocument-style-files)). To expand or further customize these built-in style sheets, either edit the style sheets directly or generate them using an application such as LibreOffice. The example here shows creating a style using LibreOffice.

## <span className="tag applyingcustomstyles">`applying custom styles`</span> the easy way

1.  Create a sample ‘`example.org`’ file with settings as shown below, and export it to ODT format.

    ```lisp
    #+OPTIONS: H:10 num:t
    ```

2.  Open the above ‘`example.odt`’ using LibreOffice. Use the *Stylist* to locate the target styles, which typically have the “Org" prefix. Open one, modify, and save as either OpenDocument Text (ODT) or OpenDocument Template (OTT) file.

3.  Customize the variable `org-odt-styles-file` and point it to the newly created file. For additional configuration options, see [Overriding factory styles](x_002doverriding_002dfactory_002dstyles).

    To apply an ODT style to a particular file, use the ‘`ODT_STYLES_FILE`’ keyword as shown in the example below:

    ```lisp
    #+ODT_STYLES_FILE: "/path/to/example.ott"
    ```

    or

    ```lisp
    #+ODT_STYLES_FILE: ("/path/to/file.ott" ("styles.xml" "image/hdr.png"))
    ```

## Using third-party styles and templates

The ODT export back-end relies on many templates and style names. Using third-party styles and templates can lead to mismatches. Templates derived from built in ODT templates and styles seem to have fewer problems.

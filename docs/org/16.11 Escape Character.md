slug: Escape-Character
---

You may sometimes want to write text that looks like Org syntax, but should really read as plain text. Org may use a specific escape character in some situations, i.e., a backslash in macros (see [Macro Replacement](Macro-Replacement)) and links (see [Link Format](Link-Format)), or a comma in source and example blocks (see [Literal Examples](Literal-Examples)). In the general case, however, we suggest to use the zero width space. You can insert one with any of the following:

```lisp
C-x 8 <RET> zero width space <RET>
C-x 8 <RET> 200B <RET>
```

For example, in order to write ‘`[[1,2]]`’ as-is in your document, you may write instead

```lisp
[X[1,2]]
```

where ‘`X`’ denotes the zero width space character.

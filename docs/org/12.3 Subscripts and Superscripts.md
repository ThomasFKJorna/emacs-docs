slug: Subscripts-and-Superscripts

‘`^`’ and ‘`_`’ are used to indicate super- and subscripts. To increase the readability of ASCII text, it is not necessary, but OK, to surround multi-character sub- and superscripts with curly braces. For example

```lisp
The radius of the sun is R_sun = 6.96 x 10^8 m.  On the other hand,
the radius of Alpha Centauri is R_{Alpha Centauri} = 1.28 x R_{sun}.
```

If you write a text where the underscore is often used in a different context, Org’s convention to always interpret these as subscripts can get in your way. Configure the variable `org-use-sub-superscripts` to change this convention. For example, when setting this variable to `{}`, ‘`a_b`’ is not interpreted as a subscript, but ‘`a_{b}`’ is.

You can set `org-use-sub-superscripts` in a file using the export option ‘`^:`’ (see [Export Settings](Export-Settings)). For example, ‘`#+OPTIONS: ^:{}`’ sets `org-use-sub-superscripts` to `{}` and limits super- and subscripts to the curly bracket notation.

You can also toggle the visual display of super- and subscripts:

### `C-c C-x \` (`org-toggle-pretty-entities`)

This command formats sub- and superscripts in a WYSIWYM way.

Set both `org-pretty-entities` and `org-pretty-entities-include-sub-superscripts` to `t` to start with super- and subscripts *visually* interpreted as specified by the option `org-use-sub-superscripts`.

If you want to output a minimal HTML file, with no CSS, no Javascript, no preamble or postamble, here are the variable you would need to set:

```lisp
(setq org-html-head ""
      org-html-head-extra ""
      org-html-head-include-default-style nil
      org-html-head-include-scripts nil
      org-html-preamble nil
      org-html-postamble nil
      org-html-use-infojs nil)
```

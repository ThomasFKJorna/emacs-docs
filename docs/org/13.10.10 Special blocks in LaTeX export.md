For other special blocks in the Org file, the LaTeX export back-end makes a special environment of the same name. The back-end also takes ‘`:options`’, if any, and appends as-is to that environment’s opening string. For example:

```lisp
#+BEGIN_abstract
  We demonstrate how to solve the Syracuse problem.
#+END_abstract

#+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Proof of important theorem]
#+BEGIN_proof
  ...
  Therefore, any even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.
#+END_proof
```

exports to

```lisp
\begin{abstract}
  We demonstrate how to solve the Syracuse problem.
\end{abstract}

\begin{proof}[Proof of important theorem]
  ...
  Therefore, any even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.
\end{proof}
```

If you need to insert a specific caption command, use ‘`:caption`’ attribute. It overrides standard ‘`CAPTION`’ value, if any. For example:

```lisp
#+ATTR_LATEX: :caption \MyCaption{HeadingA}
#+BEGIN_proof
  ...
#+END_proof
```

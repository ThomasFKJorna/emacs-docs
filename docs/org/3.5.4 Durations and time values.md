If you want to compute time values use the ‘`T`’, ‘`t`’, or ‘`U`’ flag, either in Calc formulas or Elisp formulas:

```lisp
|  Task 1 |   Task 2 |    Total |
|---------+----------+----------|
|    2:12 |     1:47 | 03:59:00 |
|    2:12 |     1:47 |    03:59 |
| 3:02:20 | -2:07:00 |     0.92 |
#+TBLFM: @2$3=$1+$2;T::@3$3=$1+$2;U::@4$3=$1+$2;t
```

Input duration values must be of the form ‘`HH:MM[:SS]`’, where seconds are optional. With the ‘`T`’ flag, computed durations are displayed as ‘`HH:MM:SS`’ (see the first formula above). With the ‘`U`’ flag, seconds are omitted so that the result is only ‘`HH:MM`’ (see second formula above). Zero-padding of the hours field depends upon the value of the variable `org-table-duration-hour-zero-padding`.

With the ‘`t`’ flag, computed durations are displayed according to the value of the option `org-table-duration-custom-format`, which defaults to `hours` and displays the result as a fraction of hours (see the third formula in the example above).

Negative duration values can be manipulated as well, and integers are considered as seconds in addition and subtraction.

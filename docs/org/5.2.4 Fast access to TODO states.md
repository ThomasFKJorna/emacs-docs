If you would like to quickly change an entry to an arbitrary TODO state instead of cycling through the states, you can set up keys for single-letter access to the states. This is done by adding the selection character after each keyword, in parentheses[^1]. For example:

```lisp
(setq org-todo-keywords
      '((sequence "TODO(t)" "|" "DONE(d)")
        (sequence "REPORT(r)" "BUG(b)" "KNOWNCAUSE(k)" "|" "FIXED(f)")
        (sequence "|" "CANCELED(c)")))
```

If you then press `C-c C-t` followed by the selection key, the entry is switched to this state. `SPC` can be used to remove any TODO keyword from an entry[^2].

[^1]: All characters are allowed except ‘`@`’, ‘`^`’ and ‘`!`’, which have a special meaning here.

[^2]: Check also the variable `org-fast-tag-selection-include-todo`, it allows you to change the TODO state through the tags interface (see [Setting Tags](/docs/org/Setting-Tags)), in case you like to mingle the two concepts. Note that this means you need to come up with unique keys across both sets of keywords.

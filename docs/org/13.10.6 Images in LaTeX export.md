The LaTeX export back-end processes image links in Org files that do not have descriptions, such as these links ‘`[[file:img.jpg]]`’ or ‘`[[./img.jpg]]`’, as direct image insertions in the final PDF output. In the PDF, they are no longer links but actual images embedded on the page. The LaTeX export back-end uses ‘`\includegraphics`’ macro to insert the image. But for TikZ ([http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgf/](/docs/org/http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgf/)) images, the back-end uses an `\input` macro wrapped within a `tikzpicture` environment.

For specifying image ‘`:width`’, ‘`:height`’, ‘`:scale`’ and other ‘`:options`’, use this syntax:

```lisp
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 5cm :options angle=90
[[./img/sed-hr4049.pdf]]
```

A ‘`:scale`’ attribute overrides both ‘`:width`’ and ‘`:height`’ attributes.

For custom commands for captions, use the ‘`:caption`’ attribute. It overrides the default ‘`#+CAPTION`’ value:

```lisp
#+ATTR_LATEX: :caption \bicaption{HeadingA}{HeadingB}
[[./img/sed-hr4049.pdf]]
```

When captions follow the method as described in [Captions](/docs/org/Captions), the LaTeX export back-end wraps the picture in a floating ‘`figure`’ environment. To float an image without specifying a caption, set the ‘`:float`’ attribute to one of the following:

### ‘`t`’

For a standard ‘`figure`’ environment; used by default whenever an image has a caption.

### ‘`multicolumn`’

To span the image across multiple columns of a page; the back-end wraps the image in a ‘`figure*`’ environment.

### ‘`wrap`’

For text to flow around the image on the right; the figure occupies the left half of the page.

### ‘`sideways`’

For a new page with the image sideways, rotated ninety degrees, in a ‘`sidewaysfigure`’ environment; overrides ‘`:placement`’ setting.

### ‘`nil`’

To avoid a ‘`:float`’ even if using a caption.

Use the ‘`placement`’ attribute to modify a floating environment’s placement.

```lisp
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float wrap :width 0.38\textwidth :placement {r}{0.4\textwidth}
[[./img/hst.png]]
```

The LaTeX export back-end centers all images by default. Setting ‘`:center`’ to ‘`nil`’ disables centering. To disable centering globally, set `org-latex-images-centered` to ‘`t`’.

Set the ‘`:comment-include`’ attribute to non-`nil` value for the LaTeX export back-end to comment out the ‘`\includegraphics`’ macro.

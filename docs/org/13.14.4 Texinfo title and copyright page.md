The default template for hard copy output has a title page with ‘`TITLE`’ and ‘`AUTHOR`’ keywords (see [Export Settings](/docs/org/Export-Settings)). To replace the regular title with something different for the printed version, use the ‘`TEXINFO_PRINTED_TITLE`’ and ‘`SUBTITLE`’ keywords. Both expect raw Texinfo code for setting their values.

If one ‘`AUTHOR`’ line is not sufficient, add multiple ‘`SUBAUTHOR`’ keywords. They have to be set in raw Texinfo code.

```lisp
#+AUTHOR: Jane Smith
#+SUBAUTHOR: John Doe
#+TEXINFO_PRINTED_TITLE: This Long Title@@inlinefmt{tex,@*} Is Broken in @TeX{}
```

Copying material is defined in a dedicated headline with a non-`nil` ‘`COPYING`’ property. The back-end inserts the contents within a ‘`@copying`’ command at the beginning of the document. The heading itself does not appear in the structure of the document.

Copyright information is printed on the back of the title page.

```lisp
* Legalese
  :PROPERTIES:
  :COPYING: t
  :END:

  This is a short example of a complete Texinfo file, version 1.0.

The Texinfo export back-end by default converts description lists in the Org file using the default command ‘`@table`’, which results in a table with two columns. To change this behavior, set ‘`:table-type`’ attribute to either ‘`ftable`’ or ‘`vtable`’ value. For more information, see [(texinfo)Two-column Tables](https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/manual/texinfo/texinfo.html#Two_002dcolumn-Tables).

The Texinfo export back-end by default also applies a text highlight based on the defaults stored in `org-texinfo-table-default-markup`. To override the default highlight command, specify another one with the ‘`:indic`’ attribute.

Org syntax is limited to one entry per list item. Nevertheless, the Texinfo export back-end can split that entry according to any text provided through the ‘`:sep`’ attribute. Each part then becomes a new entry in the first column of the table.

The following example illustrates all the attributes above:

```lisp
#+ATTR_TEXINFO: :table-type vtable :sep , :indic asis
- foo, bar :: This is the common text for variables foo and bar.
```

becomes

```lisp
@vtable @asis
@item foo
@itemx bar
This is the common text for variables foo and bar.
@end table
```

Ordered lists are numbered when exported to Texinfo format. Such numbering obeys any counter (see [Plain Lists](/docs/org/Plain-Lists)) in the first item of the list. The ‘`:enum`’ attribute also let you start the list at a specific number, or switch to a lettered list, as illustrated here

```lisp
#+ATTR_TEXINFO: :enum A
1. Alpha
2. Bravo
3. Charlie
```

slug: Initial-visibility

When Emacs first visits an Org file, the global state is set to `showeverything`, i.e., all file content is visible[^1]. This can be configured through the variable `org-startup-folded`, or on a per-file basis by adding one of the following lines anywhere in the buffer:

```lisp
#+STARTUP: overview
#+STARTUP: content
#+STARTUP: showall
#+STARTUP: showeverything
```

Furthermore, any entries with a ‘`VISIBILITY`’ property (see [Properties and Columns](/docs/org/Properties-and-Columns)) get their visibility adapted accordingly. Allowed values for this property are ‘`folded`’, ‘`children`’, ‘`content`’, and ‘`all`’.

### `C-u C-u TAB` (`org-set-startup-visibility`)

Switch back to the startup visibility of the buffer, i.e., whatever is requested by startup options and ‘`VISIBILITY`’ properties in individual entries.

[^1]: When `org-agenda-inhibit-startup` is non-`nil`, Org does not honor the default visibility state when first opening a file for the agenda (see [Speeding Up Your Agendas](/docs/org/Speeding-Up-Your-Agendas)).

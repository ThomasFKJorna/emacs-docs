To display the buffer in the indented view, activate Org Indent minor mode, using `M-x org-indent-mode`. Text lines that are not headlines are prefixed with virtual spaces to vertically align with the headline text[^1].

To make more horizontal space, the headlines are shifted by two characters. Configure `org-indent-indentation-per-level` variable for a different number.

By default, Org Indent mode turns off `org-adapt-indentation` and does hide leading stars by locally setting `org-hide-leading-stars` to `t`: only one star on each headline is visible, the rest are masked with the same font color as the background. If you want to customize this default behavior, see `org-indent-mode-turns-on-hiding-stars` and `org-indent-mode-turns-off-org-adapt-indentation`.

To globally turn on Org Indent mode for all files, customize the variable `org-startup-indented`. To control it for individual files, use ‘`STARTUP`’ keyword as follows:

```lisp
#+STARTUP: indent
#+STARTUP: noindent
```

[^1]: Org Indent mode also sets `wrap-prefix` correctly for indenting and wrapping long lines of headlines or text. This minor mode also handles Visual Line mode and directly applied settings through `word-wrap`.

Once properly configured, Org can publish with the following commands:

### `C-c C-e P x` (`org-publish`)

Prompt for a specific project and publish all files that belong to it.

### `C-c C-e P p` (`org-publish-current-project`)

Publish the project containing the current file.

### `C-c C-e P f` (`org-publish-current-file`)

Publish only the current file.

### `C-c C-e P a` (`org-publish-all`)

Publish every project.

Org uses timestamps to track when a file has changed. The above functions normally only publish changed files. You can override this and force publishing of all files by giving a prefix argument to any of the commands above, or by customizing the variable `org-publish-use-timestamps-flag`. This may be necessary in particular if files include other files via ‘`SETUPFILE`’ or ‘`INCLUDE`’ keywords.

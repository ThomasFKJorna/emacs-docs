This agenda view is a general text search facility for Org mode entries. It is particularly useful to find notes.

### `M-x org-agenda s` (`org-search-view`)

This is a special search that lets you select entries by matching a substring or specific words using a boolean logic.

For example, the search string ‘`computer equipment`’ matches entries that contain ‘`computer equipment`’ as a substring, even if the two words are separated by more space or a line break.

Search view can also search for specific keywords in the entry, using Boolean logic. The search string ‘`+computer +wifi -ethernet -{8\.11[bg]}`’ matches note entries that contain the keywords ‘`computer`’ and ‘`wifi`’, but not the keyword ‘`ethernet`’, and which are also not matched by the regular expression ‘`8\.11[bg]`’, meaning to exclude both ‘`8.11b`’ and ‘`8.11g`’. The first ‘`+`’ is necessary to turn on boolean search, other ‘`+`’ characters are optional. For more details, see the docstring of the command `org-search-view`.

You can incrementally and conveniently adjust a boolean search from the agenda search view with the following keys

|     |                                   |
| --- | --------------------------------- |
| `[` | Add a positive search word        |
| `]` | Add a negative search word        |
| `{` | Add a positive regular expression |
| `}` | Add a negative regular expression |

Note that in addition to the agenda files, this command also searches the files listed in `org-agenda-text-search-extra-files`.

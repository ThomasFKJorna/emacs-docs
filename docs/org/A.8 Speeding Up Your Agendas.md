Some agenda commands slow down when the Org files grow in size or number. Here are tips to speed up:

*   Reduce the number of Org agenda files to avoid slowdowns due to hard drive accesses.

*   Reduce the number of DONE and archived headlines so agenda operations that skip over these can finish faster.

*   Do not dim blocked tasks:

    ```lisp
    (setq org-agenda-dim-blocked-tasks nil)
    ```

*   Stop preparing agenda buffers on startup:

    ```lisp
    (setq org-agenda-inhibit-startup t)
    ```

*   Disable tag inheritance for agendas:

    ```lisp
    (setq org-agenda-use-tag-inheritance nil)
    ```

These options can be applied to selected agenda views. For more details about generation of agenda views, see the docstrings for the relevant variables, and this [dedicated Worg page](https://orgmode.org/worg/agenda-optimization.html) for agenda optimization.

## Embedding images

The ODT export back-end processes image links in Org files that do not have descriptions, such as these links ‘`[[file:img.jpg]]`’ or ‘`[[./img.jpg]]`’, as direct image insertions in the final output. Either of these examples works:

```lisp
[[file:img.png]]
```

```lisp
[[./img.png]]
```

## Embedding clickable images

For clickable images, provide a link whose description is another link to an image file. For example, to embed an image ‘`org-mode-unicorn.png`’ which when clicked jumps to [https://orgmode.org](https://orgmode.org) website, do the following

```lisp
[[https://orgmode.org][./org-mode-unicorn.png]]
```

## Sizing and scaling of embedded images

Control the size and scale of the embedded images with the ‘`ATTR_ODT`’ attribute.

The ODT export back-end starts with establishing the size of the image in the final document. The dimensions of this size are measured in centimeters. The back-end then queries the image file for its dimensions measured in pixels. For this measurement, the back-end relies on ImageMagick’s identify program or Emacs `create-image` and `image-size` API. ImageMagick is the preferred choice for large file sizes or frequent batch operations. The back-end then converts the pixel dimensions using `org-odt-pixels-per-inch` into the familiar 72 dpi or 96 dpi. The default value for this is in `display-pixels-per-inch`, which can be tweaked for better results based on the capabilities of the output device. Here are some common image scaling operations:

### Explicitly size the image

To embed ‘`img.png`’ as a 10 cm x 10 cm image, do the following:

```lisp
#+ATTR_ODT: :width 10 :height 10
[[./img.png]]
```

### Scale the image

To embed ‘`img.png`’ at half its size, do the following:

```lisp
#+ATTR_ODT: :scale 0.5
[[./img.png]]
```

### Scale the image to a specific width

To embed ‘`img.png`’ with a width of 10 cm while retaining the original height:width ratio, do the following:

```lisp
#+ATTR_ODT: :width 10
[[./img.png]]
```

### Scale the image to a specific height

To embed ‘`img.png`’ with a height of 10 cm while retaining the original height:width ratio, do the following:

```lisp
#+ATTR_ODT: :height 10
[[./img.png]]
```

## Anchoring of images

The ODT export back-end can anchor images to ‘`as-char`’, ‘`paragraph`’, or ‘`page`’. Set the preferred anchor using the ‘`:anchor`’ property of the ‘`ATTR_ODT`’ line.

To create an image that is anchored to a page:

```lisp
#+ATTR_ODT: :anchor page
[[./img.png]]
```

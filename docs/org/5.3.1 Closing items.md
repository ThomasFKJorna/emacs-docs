The most basic automatic logging is to keep track of *when* a certain TODO item was marked as done. This can be achieved with[^1]

```lisp
(setq org-log-done 'time)
```

Then each time you turn an entry from a TODO (not-done) state into any of the DONE states, a line ‘`CLOSED: [timestamp]`’ is inserted just after the headline. If you turn the entry back into a TODO item through further state cycling, that line is removed again. If you turn the entry back to a non-TODO state (by pressing `C-c C-t SPC` for example), that line is also removed, unless you set `org-closed-keep-when-no-todo` to non-`nil`. If you want to record a note along with the timestamp, use[^2]

```lisp
(setq org-log-done 'note)
```

You are then prompted for a note, and that note is stored below the entry with a ‘`Closing Note`’ heading.

[^1]: The corresponding in-buffer setting is: ‘`#+STARTUP: logdone`’.

[^2]: The corresponding in-buffer setting is: ‘`#+STARTUP: lognotedone`’.

The â€œLibrary of Babel" is a collection of code blocks. Like a function library, these code blocks can be called from other Org files. A collection of useful code blocks is available on [Worg](https://orgmode.org/worg/library-of-babel.html). For remote code block evaluation syntax, see [Evaluating Code Blocks](Evaluating-Code-Blocks).

For any user to add code to the library, first save the code in regular code blocks of an Org file, and then load the Org file with `org-babel-lob-ingest`, which is bound to `C-c C-v i`.

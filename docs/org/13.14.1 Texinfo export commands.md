### `C-c C-e i t` (`org-texinfo-export-to-texinfo`)

Export as a Texinfo file with ‘`.texi`’ extension. For ‘`myfile.org`’, Org exports to ‘`myfile.texi`’, overwriting without warning.

### `C-c C-e i i` (`org-texinfo-export-to-info`)

Export to Texinfo format first and then process it to make an Info file. To generate other formats, such as DocBook, customize the `org-texinfo-info-process` variable.

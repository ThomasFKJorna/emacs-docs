You can write the text of a quotation within a quote block (see [Paragraphs](Paragraphs)). You may also emphasize some text at the beginning of the quotation with the ‘`:tag`’ attribute.

```lisp
#+ATTR_TEXINFO: :tag Warning
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Striking your thumb with a hammer may cause severe pain and discomfort.
#+END_QUOTE
```

To specify the author of the quotation, use the ‘`:author`’ attribute.

```lisp
#+ATTR_TEXINFO: :author King Arthur
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite,
held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water, signifying by divine
providence that I, Arthur, was to carry Excalibur. That is why I am
your king.
#+END_QUOTE
```

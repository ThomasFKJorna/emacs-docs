When in an Org buffer and the region is active, some commands will apply to all the subtrees in the active region. For example, hitting `C-c C-s` when multiple headlines are within the active region will successively prompt you for a new schedule date and time. To disable this, set the option `org-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region` to non-`t`, activate the region and run the command normally.

`org-agenda-loop-over-headlines-in-active-region` is the equivalent option of the agenda buffer, where you can also use [bulk editing of selected entries](/docs/org/Bulk-remote-editing-selected-entries).

Not all commands can loop in the active region and what subtrees or headlines are considered can be refined: see the docstrings of these options for more details.

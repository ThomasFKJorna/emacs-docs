## TODO keywords, tags, properties, etc.

Org uses various syntactical elements: TODO keywords, tags, property names, keywords, blocks, etc. In this manual we use the following conventions:

### ‘`TODO`’

### ‘`WAITING`’

TODO keywords are written with all capitals, even if they are user-defined.

### ‘`boss`’

### ‘`ARCHIVE`’

Tags are case-sensitive. User-defined tags are written in lowercase; built-in tags with special meaning are written as they should appear in the document, usually with all capitals.

### ‘`Release`’

### ‘`PRIORITY`’

User-defined properties are capitalized; built-in properties with special meaning are written with all capitals.

### ‘`TITLE`’

### ‘`BEGIN`’ … ‘`END`’

Keywords and blocks are written in uppercase to enhance their readability, but you can use lowercase in your Org files.

## Key bindings and commands

The manual lists both the keys and the corresponding commands for accessing a functionality. Org mode often uses the same key for different functions, depending on context. The command that is bound to such keys has a generic name, like `org-metaright`. In the manual we will, wherever possible, give the function that is internally called by the generic command. For example, in the chapter on document structure, `M-RIGHT` will be listed to call `org-do-demote`, while in the chapter on tables, it will be listed to call `org-table-move-column-right`.

Org mode checks each agenda item for a time-of-day specification. The time can be part of the timestamp that triggered inclusion into the agenda, for example

```lisp
<2005-05-10 Tue 19:00>
```

Time ranges can be specified with two timestamps:

```lisp
<2005-05-10 Tue 20:30>--<2005-05-10 Tue 22:15>
```

In the headline of the entry itself, a time(range)—like ‘`12:45`’ or a ‘`8:30-1pm`’—may also appear as plain text[^1].

If the agenda integrates the Emacs diary (see [Weekly/daily agenda](/docs/org/Weekly_002fdaily-agenda)), time specifications in diary entries are recognized as well.

For agenda display, Org mode extracts the time and displays it in a standard 24 hour format as part of the prefix. The example times in the previous paragraphs would end up in the agenda like this:

```lisp
 8:30-13:00 Arthur Dent lies in front of the bulldozer
12:45...... Ford Prefect arrives and takes Arthur to the pub
19:00...... The Vogon reads his poem
20:30-22:15 Marvin escorts the Hitchhikers to the bridge
```

If the agenda is in single-day mode, or for the display of today, the timed entries are embedded in a time grid, like

```lisp
 8:00...... ------------------
 8:30-13:00 Arthur Dent lies in front of the bulldozer
10:00...... ------------------
12:00...... ------------------
12:45...... Ford Prefect arrives and takes Arthur to the pub
14:00...... ------------------
16:00...... ------------------
18:00...... ------------------
19:00...... The Vogon reads his poem
20:00...... ------------------
20:30-22:15 Marvin escorts the Hitchhikers to the bridge
```

The time grid can be turned on and off with the variable `org-agenda-use-time-grid`, and can be configured with `org-agenda-time-grid`.

[^1]: You can, however, disable this by setting `org-agenda-search-headline-for-time` variable to a `nil` value.

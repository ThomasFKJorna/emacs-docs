slug: Catching-invisible-edits
---

Sometimes you may inadvertently edit an invisible part of the buffer and be confused on what has been edited and how to undo the mistake. Setting `org-catch-invisible-edits` to non-`nil` helps preventing this. See the docstring of this option on how Org should catch invisible edits and process them.

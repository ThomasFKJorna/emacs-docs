slug: Indices

The Texinfo export back-end recognizes these indexing keywords if used in the Org file: ‘`CINDEX`’, ‘`FINDEX`’, ‘`KINDEX`’, ‘`PINDEX`’, ‘`TINDEX`’ and ‘`VINDEX`’. Write their value as verbatim Texinfo code; in particular, ‘`{`’, ‘`}`’ and ‘`@`’ characters need to be escaped with ‘`@`’ if they do not belong to a Texinfo command.

```lisp
#+CINDEX: Defining indexing entries
```

For the back-end to generate an index entry for a headline, set the ‘`INDEX`’ property to ‘`cp`’ or ‘`vr`’. These abbreviations come from Texinfo that stand for concept index and variable index. The Texinfo manual has abbreviations for all other kinds of indexes. The back-end exports the headline as an unnumbered chapter or section command, and then inserts the index after its contents.

```lisp
* Concept Index
  :PROPERTIES:
  :INDEX: cp
  :END:
```

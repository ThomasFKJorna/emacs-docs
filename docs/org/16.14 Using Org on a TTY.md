Org provides alternative key bindings for TTY and modern mobile devices that cannot perform movement commands on point and key bindings with modifier keys. Some of these workarounds may be more cumbersome than necessary. Users should look into customizing these further based on their usage needs. For example, the normal `S-<cursor>` for editing timestamp might be better with `C-c .` chord.

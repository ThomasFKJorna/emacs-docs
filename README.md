# Emacs Docs

> The modern documentation website Emacs deserves.

## Why

I didn't particularly enjoy either browsing the manual online or in Emacs, and wished there was a modern equivalent. Luckily, there is now!

## Included manuals

- Emacs Manual [source](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/emacs.html)
- Emacs Lisp Manual [source](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/elisp.html)
- Org Mode Manual [source](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/org.html)
- AUCTeX Manual [source](https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/auctex.index.html)

### How to include other things

Only documentation for Emacs core and Emacs packages will be included, which must satisfy the following requirements:

1. Be licensed under a free documentation license such as the GNU Free Documentation License 1.3 or Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license. To the best of my knowledge I cannot include GLPv3 licensed materials under the GFDLv1.3 license governing the contents of the website, so at the time of writing (30 Nov 2021) I will not add manuals with such a license.
2. Are available in either Markdown or big-single-page HTML format.
3. Are authoritative references on parts of GNU Emacs or packages interacting with GNU Emacs.

Point 1. excludes Magit from being included, ~sadly~ for now, see https://github.com/ThomasFKJorna/emacs-docs/#1 for up to date discussion.

## FAQs

Please see [the FAQs](https://emacsdocs.org/blog/faq)

## Misc

The scripts used to convert the HTML manuals to Markdown can be found [here](https://github.com/ThomasFKJorna/emacs-docs-converter). Please note that it's extremely jank and will be substantially revised in the future, contributors are welcome, but you've been warned!

## Comments and Feedback

If you have any ideas or feddback about the project or the design of the website, please open a disccusion! I'd be more than happy to talk to discuss this further.

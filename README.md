> The modern documentation website Emacs deserves.

## Why

I didn't particularly enjoy either browsing the manual online or in Emacs, and wished there was a modern equivalent. Luckily, there is now!

## Included manuals

- Emacs Manual [source](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/emacs.html)
- Emacs Lisp Manual [source](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/elisp.html)
- Org Mode Manual [source](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/org.html)
- AUCTeX Manual [source](https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/auctex.index.html)
- Magit Manual [source](https://magit.vc/manual/magit/)

### How to include other manuals

Only documentation for Emacs core and Emacs packages will be included, which must satisfy the following requirements:

1. Be licensed under a free documentation license such as the GNU Free Documentation License 1.3 or Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license or other free software licenses such as the GPLv3 or MIT.
2. Are available in either Markdown or big-single-page HTML format.
3. Are authoritative references on parts of GNU Emacs or packages interacting with GNU Emacs.

## Misc

The scripts used to convert the HTML manuals to Markdown can be found [here](https://github.com/ThomasFKJorna/emacs-docs-converter). Please note that it's extremely jank and will be substantially revised in the future, contributors are welcome, but you've been warned!

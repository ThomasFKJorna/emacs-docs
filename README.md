# Emacs Docs

> The modern documentation website Emacs deserves.

## Why

I didn't particularly enjoy either browsing the manual online or in Emacs, and wished there was a modern equivalent. Luckily, there is now!

## Included manuals

- Emacs Manual [source](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/emacs.html)
- Emacs Lisp Manual [source](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/elisp.html)
- Org Mode Manual [source](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/org.html)
- AUCTeX Manual [source](https://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/manual/auctex.index.html)

### How to include other things

Only documentation for Emacs core and Emacs packages will be included, which must satisfy the following requirements:

1. Be licensed under a free documentation license such as the GNU Free Documentation License 1.3, Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 or Creative Commons Attribution-Share-Alike 4.0 License, etc. This EXCLUDES documentation licensed under the GPLv3, as it's incompatible with the GFDL.
2. Are available in either Markdown or big-single-page HTML format.

Point 1. excludes Magit from being included, sadly.

## FAQs

Please see [the FAQs](https://emacsdocs.org/blog/faq)

## Misc

The build script which pulls the manuals from the GNU website and converts them into MD files is not yet included here on accounts of it being extremely janky. I will publish it when it's polished further, which would allow the website to be built from scratch on every build.

## Comments and Feedback

If you have any ideas or feddback about the project or the design of the website, please open a disccusion! I'd be more than happy to talk to discuss this further.

> Unofficial Emacs Documentation for the 21st century.

## Why

I like clicking things.

## Included manuals

- Emacs Manual (source, license)
- Emacs Lisp Manual (source, license)
- Org Mode Manual (source, license)
- AUCTeX Manual (source, license)

### How to include other things

Only documentation for Emacs core and Emacs packages will be included, which must satisfy the following requirements:

1. Be licensed under a free documentation license such as the GNU Free Documentation License 1.3, Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 or Creative Commons Attribution-Share-Alike 4.0 License, etc. This EXCLUDES documentation licensed under the GPLv3, as it's incompatible with the GFDL.
2. Are available in either Markdown or big-single-page HTML format.

Point 1. excludes Magit from being included, sadly.

Make an issue, or try to run `converter.js` on the full text version of the manual.
